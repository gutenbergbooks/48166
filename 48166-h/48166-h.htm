<h3><i>CHAPTER IV.</i><br />

<small>THE HEROIC AGE—GROWTH OF THE RUSSIAN STATE, TO THE<br />
DEATH OF IAROSLAF (1054).</small></h3>

<p>The glory of the Russian arms, the splendor of the Russian
State, attained their maximum in the reign of the great
Iaroslaf. Its form of government continued to retain the
Variag-Slav elements, but was compacted and confirmed by
the ideas brought into the country with the influx of Greek
priests and men of letters. The prince long remained, as
in the primitive times, first among his equals, the drujina—the
head and chief of a family of soldiers. He had great
respect for the counsels, and for the demands of these. Vladimir’s
men complained, in that they had to eat from wooden
bowls. He forthwith provided them with silver ones. “I can
not buy myself a drujina with silver and gold,” he said, “but
with a drujina I can obtain silver and gold, as did my father
and my grandfather.” The Roman empire of the east represented
another form of government. Its sovereign was the
heir of Constantine and of Augustus; the vicar of God upon
earth, the human representative of the Sovereign of the universe.
The Greek emperor derived his power, not from the
consent of his subjects—a phrase unknown in his dominions,—but
rather from the Being who conferred it as a prerogative,
a divine right. His person, his regalia, were sacred.
The populace of Constantinople believed that when God
gave the empire to their city, he gave it also the regal vestments
at the hands of an angel. Leo, king of the Kazarui,
was said to have been smitten with a fatal ulcer for his temerity
in putting the Byzantine crown upon his head. This
Roman, and antecedently Asiatic conception of government,
as vested in the person of the imperator who made
the laws, executed justice, received the adoring homage
as well as the unquestioning obedience of his subjects, essentially
modified the nobler, freer idea of government, as
held by the Variag princes; but the change was wrought
gradually, and was hardly perceptible during the epoch of
the ascendency of the Russia of the steppes, the supremacy
of Kief. It came into prominence, as we shall see, in the
Russia of the forests, when Suzdal, and later Moscow, became
the nuclei, the centers of the realm in a subsequent epoch.
Iaroslaf compiled a code of laws, the Russkaia Pravda, the
Russian right, or verity, a code that, though subsequently
modified by Byzantine influence, remained for centuries the
basis of the national jurisprudence. The laws of the Pravda
are in effect those of ancient Scandinavia. Private revenge
and avenging are recognized, as are also the judicial duel
and the ordeals; fines are fixed for various crimes. The
primitive form of trial by jury is established, but none of the
harsher penalties are prescribed that were introduced later
by the corrupted Greeks. Prisons, torture to wring confession,
corporal cruelties, flogging and capital punishment
were unknown in the Russia of the eleventh century. Its
laws were milder, more humane than those of Charlemagne.
The Slav had not become debased by the vices of the Roman
empire of the east, nor by the ferocity of the Tatars. “A
white Arab,” a child of nature, uncorrupted by the iniquities
of an ancient civilization, with his ardent Oriental temperament,
he retained as yet much of the simplicity, the
freedom from duplicity, that won the recognition of Homer,
Choerilius and Strabo.</p>

<p>The introduction of Greek Christianity was a fact of immeasurable
significance to the Russian realm. It proscribed
the Papal Church from Russian territory, and thereby isolated
it from the nations of the west. This isolation precluded
the Russian people from the religious sympathy, the
material support of the Pope, and of the other European
nations, in crises of peril, or periods of emergency, such as
that of the appalling Tatar invasion. They could look for
no help beyond their own resources, their own strength.
The difference of religion served also as a perpetual barrier,
a continually irritating antagonism between the Russian and
the Polish Slavs. On the other hand, as the new faith was
introduced by means of the Slavonic, the mother tongue,
Russian society was spared the sharp division between the
clerical, the learned, the high, Latin-speaking class, and the
lower classes that compose the bulk of every nation; a division
that contributed immensely to the founding of caste
and to the arrogations of a hierarchy throughout Latin
Christendom. In Russia was reared a national church, subject
to no foreign, no alien sway, entangled with no foreign
alliances or foreign politics. Thus was secured an absolute
national and ecclesiastical independence. “No dragonnades,
no frightful inquisition, no Saint Bartholomews, no
myriads of martyrs, no hideous tortures, such as those invented
and practiced by Jesuits and Romish priests, have
ever defiled the venerable ministry that traces its origin to
Ephesus and Saint John.”</p>

<p>Christianity gradually but essentially modified the social
life, the customs and manners of the people. It abolished
polygamy; the structure of the family was no longer
Asiatic, but European. It heightened the Slav virtues of
hospitality and benevolence, by inculcating the humanitarian
precepts of the New Testament. It conferred a dignity
previously unknown, upon weakness, infirmity, poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and labor. It modified the public sentiment in regard
to crime, by teaching the inherent heinousness of sin. The
oft-uttered words of Vladimir, “I fear to sin,” indicate the
change that was gradually effected in the popular mind.
Assassination, theft, and other crimes ceased to be regarded
as private injuries, to be commuted by fines or atoned for by
reprisals. They were punished as offences against humanity,
in the name of the Legislator, the Father of the race.
What is more precious than a Christian soul? asks one of
the earlier descendants and successors of Vladimir. The
new religion brought music in its train to a people who had
a capacity for this art, but who were ignorant of its first
principles. It brought architecture into a realm whose
buildings were simply wooden tents, and whose ramparts
were made of mud. In the rude city were laid the decorated
aisles, the sumptuous columns, the golden cupolas and
domes of the Russian church. It brought literature, first of
all by the sacred books translated into the vernacular; the
works of the Church fathers, among them Basil and Chrysostom;
the lives of the saints, Byzantine chronicles, eagerly
read by the scholastic monk; works on speculative and
natural philosophy, and some few romances. Contemporary
Byzantine literature was not of the highest order; but
exported among a people whose thought and knowledge
were limited to the recital of their national legends, their
primitive poems, it aroused their germinant powers, and
gave direction to their intellectual, their social, and their
moral development. We have to concede, however, that
the introduction of the Greek form of Christian belief
was not entirely salutary in its effects upon the people
at large. The Byzantine Church was smitten with the
decay whereof the Byzantine civilization was perishing.
It retained, indeed, the elevated truths of the Christian
system, but had deplorably lost the spirit that alone
“giveth life.” It had failed, generally speaking, to eradicate
the distinctive vices of the Greek peoples—falsehood,
treachery, perfidy, instability. In place of a regenerated
nature, it required of its adherents participation in its
elaborate ceremonial, the practice of its intricate rites,
homage to its imposing forms. It did little for intellectual
enlightenment or advancement, save in the perverted
form of Oriental monachism,—a painfully unnatural mode
of life, calculated to foster mental disease and general self-stultification.
With no arrogations of secular or of civil
power, it has associated itself throughout Russian history
with the baleful conservatism, the hoary tyranny, the enslaving
autocracy of her sovereigns. Oriental in its origin,
it has fastened upon the Russian State the stationary
ignorance, the servitude, the mental inertia of the effete
Oriental nations. Among its adherents we shall find
scarcely an example of the moral and spiritual liberty
wherewith the Head of the Church maketh his children
free. So far removed are they from this freedom, that their
spiritual debasement, their intellectual bondage and moral
perversion lie like an incubus, against which thus far the
inherent strength of the nation has struggled in vain. An
Oriental autocracy and a church devoid of spiritual vitality
have hitherto proved immovable checks upon the advancement
of the Russian people. Not without reason does the
Nihilist reject the wretched ecclesiasticism that has misguided
and miseducated his race throughout a thousand
years.</p>

<p>The portraits of Rurik and his Variag-Slav successors,
preserved in the imperial galleries of St. Petersburgh, are
doubtless much idealized; yet they may be supposed to
bear some resemblance to their originals, for Byzantine
artists were in Kief as early as the reign of Vladimir (972).
The face of Rurik is strong, and possessed of a primitive
majesty; beneath heavy brows his eyes are steadfast, penetrating,
containing a force that under stress might break
into the Berserker rage, the fury that was a characteristic of
the ancient Norse warrior. The contours of the face are
vigorous, and marked by a certain rude symmetry, so to
speak. The heavy mustaches part above the lips; below
them falls a dense beard that clings to the sides of the
cheeks and climbs to the hair. The head is shielded beneath
a plain helmet terminating above in a talon. From
the under side of the helmet falls a cape of mail, protecting
the throat and shoulders; a sack or loose coat of mail
covers the body. A man to put one’s trust in, a man to be
feared as an enemy, is the impression conveyed by the portrait,
as a whole.</p>

<p>Vladimir, “the beautiful sun of Kief,” the Christianized
Apollo of the Russian Slav, the apotheosized hero of numberless
legends and poems, still current among his people,
is represented with a richly jewelled crown above an
ermine border, resting upon his shapely head. His dark
hair falls flowing upon his shoulders; his beard is fine and
waved; his eyebrows delicately pencilled. Poetry and
song lie in his liquid eyes and upon his well-moulded lips.
A touch of sadness allied with a princely stateliness adds
an indefinable, a melodious charm to this beautiful portrait,
that one might take at first glance for a humanized
representation of the Son of Man. Lovely, tender, strong,
it is not difficult to ascribe to the gracious influences of
Christianity the elevation, the chastened symmetry, the
perceptible advance, evident in the face, from the rude
power of the Norse physiognomy. A bust like unto it, set
amid the busts of ancient Athens, would have elicited
expressions of admiration from the beholders. “A noble, a
beautiful barbarian!” they would have exclaimed.</p>

<p>The portrait of Iaroslaf represents a distinctive Slav. It
depicts a melancholy temperament held in equipoise by a
clear intellect and a firm will. Delicacy, a capacity for
sadness and strength, combine in the intelligence of the
face; an intelligence more reposeful than animated. The
symmetry of the features is remarkable. The long-lidded,
serious eyes are essentially Slavic. The throat is large
and shapely. The regal robe is heavily broidered, decorated
around the neck and down the front with a band of
light-hued fur. A grave man, with capacities for understanding
the arts that give solace and charm to existence,
Iaroslaf the Great was also a man to love and to be loved.
Captain, sovereign, legislator, he was especially the father
of his people in his affectionate care of, and in his intercourse
with them.</p>

<p>The Slav’s inextinguishable passion for liberty, and the
faithfulness of the Variag to his ruler, his capacity for obedience
and for martial discipline, augured well for the
nascent Russian state. The Slav conception of the family,
however, dominated long over that of a compact government.
The Byzantine form of political unity took root in
Russian soil, but was of slow growth, and was long obstructed
by the division of lands among the heirs of the
reigning prince—a Slavic custom observed from time immemorial.
Iaroslaf had designed that his eldest son should
succeed him upon his throne; and upon his death-bed he
urged upon his other children the duty of recognizing their
brother Isiaslaf as their sovereign; they were to regard
him “as a father.” But notwithstanding the precautions
of the great prince, the Slavic custom of division prevailed
with those who came after him. As a consequence, the
hundred and thirty years following his death (1054-1224),
form a period of internal partition, of disturbance, of civil
wars and strifes between the increasingly numerous members
of the royal family. During this period the realm
was divided into no less than sixty-four duchies or principalities,
under the varying possession of two hundred and
ninety-three princes. These partitions were the occasion
of eighty-three civil wars, some of which brought into conflict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the entire fighting force of the nation. In addition to
the internal contentions, the barbarians remained a hostile
element in the country. The chroniclers record forty-six
invasions of the Polovtsui, and eighteen campaigns directed
against them. This anarchy of princes in eastern
Europe possessed features of similarity with the feudal anarchy
of the west. The principalities of Russia corresponded
with the domains of the dukes, grafs, land-grafs,
and mar-grafs of Germany, with those of the lords and
counts of France, and with the governments of the lords
and barons of England.</p>

<p>The principality or grand duchy of Kief remained preëminent
among these divisions. Its position near to,
and its intercourse with the Greek empire, its control of the
Dnieper, the fertility of the Warm Soil, the illustrious history
of the capital and metropolis of the realm, mother of
Russian cities, all contributed to maintain its supremacy.
Its prince was the Grand Prince, chief among his fellow
rulers elsewhere in the realm, in point of privilege. Often
was his territory hotly contested by those princes whose
energy or ambition impelled them to audacious enterprises.
To obtain Kief and the position of Grand Prince, were the
ends ardently coveted by the restless, warlike rulers who
chafed within the restricted limits of their obscure domains.</p>

<p>Along the tributaries to the east of the Dnieper, lay the
principalities of Tchernigof and of Novgorod-Severski.
The ruling family of Tchernigof, the Olgovitchi, who traced
their lineage to the illustrious Olga, were the most formidable
rivals of Kief. East of these lay the double principality
of Riazan and Murom, whose chief towns, respectively
of the same name, the one on the Moskova, the other
on the Oka, indicate their ancient principalities on the
modern map of the empire. Westward, in the heart of
mediæval Russia, inclosing within its boundaries the great
forest of Okof, where rise the Volga, the Dnieper, and the
Dwina, was the principality of Smolensk, all of whose
towns were built on the banks of one or another of its great
rivers. Its political importance lay in its control of nearly
all the commerce of the realm. A government in the later
divisions of the empire bears the name of the ancient principality.
Near by was Toropets, capital of a secondary domain
ruled over by two princes of renown, Mstislaf the Brave,
and his son Mstislaf the Bold, glorious names in the history
of their country. Further to the northeast, in the
dense forests of the Volga and the Oka, lay the principality
of Suzdal, with its towns, Suzdal, Rostof, Vladimir-on-the-Kliasma.
This rugged region at the extremity of the Russia
of the eleventh century, encircled by aboriginal Finn
tribes, was destined in time to achieve a supremacy over
all the other principalities, and to control the destinies of
the nation. The Slavs of the Volga, mingling with the
Finn tribes, Muromians, Meria, Tcheremisa, who, from
being their enemies, were ultimately forced to become their
subjects, produced a modified race, endowed with permanent,
salient characteristics. The Russia of the steppes of
the Dnieper, gave way gradually, and yielded its supremacy
to the Russia of the forests of the Volga. From
the principality of Suzdal emerged the Grand Duchy or
Tsarate of Moscow, and from the Tsarate of Moscow arose
Little and Great Russia, with which were included in the
fifteenth century Red and White Russia, the Warm Soil,
and other vast territories that combine to form the European
portion of the modern empire. The principalities we
have named presented a frontier against the untamed
tribes of the steppes and of the forests. A northern system
of frontier defences holding in check the Lithuanians,
Letts, and Tchudi, was re-enforced by the powerful governments
of Novgorod and Pskof, situated in the regions of
Lake Ilmen and Lake Peïpus. Within the protection of
these domains lay two secondary appanages, Polotsk and
Mursk, the latter in the basin of the Dnieper. In southwest
Russia lay Volhynia and Gallicia, or Red Russia,
one of whose cities was Galitch. Gallicia was peopled by
the White Kroats, a branch of the Danubian Slavs, who
had affinities with the neighboring kingdoms of Poland
and Hungary. Igor, Prince of Novgorod-Severski, is the
hero of a Russian epic, that relates his expeditions. In it
the wealth and glory of Gallicia are thus exalted: “Iaroslaf
Osmomuisl of Gallicia,” cries the poet, apostrophizing
the prince, “lofty is thy throne of beaten gold! Thou
holdest up the Carpathians with thy regiments of iron!
Thou art he who shutteth the gates of the Danube, and
putteth a bar across the pathway of the King of Hungary.
At thy good pleasure the gates of Kief are opened. With
thine arrows thou smiteth from afar!”</p>

<p>The division into appanages delayed but did not strike
at the root of the unity of the empire. Nay, it may be
said to have nourished this idea in its nascent development.
At the death of every powerful sovereign fresh divisions
were made; hence no principality remained sufficiently
secure to become the home of a distinct, an enduring
nationality. Identity of race, of language, and of
religion characterized these states, whose princes were
kinsmen, and whose ties of blood were strengthened in many
instances by the bonds of wedlock. The descendants of
Rurik bore rule from the Straits of Ienikale to the borders
of the Frozen Sea. The Grand Prince was held in fatherly
respect; and if some of his contemporaries stood ready to
contend for his throne, more were at hand to defend him
with their money and their arms. The unity of the nation,
notwithstanding its numerous divisions, was more distinct
than that of Germany or of France during certain periods
of the mediæval era. The isolation of the Russian realm
maintained the permanence of this idea, in that it was
preserved from alien invaders, and from diplomatic or
other complications with powers that might have interfered
with its internal affairs, or that might have modified
its advancement. The unity of the realm initiated by
Rurik, was developed gradually but irresistibly, and with
no considerable fluctuations down to the national uprising
in 1612, when it attained its fullest strength, and rendered
the nation impregnable alike to the designs of aliens, or to
the subversions of internal discord.</p>

<p class='center'>By C. E. BISHOP.</p>


<h3>III.—THE FIGHTING TROUBADOUR’S RETURN FROM
THE WAR.</h3>

<p>Concerning the “good old days” of chivalry and the crusades,
the London <i>Quarterly Review</i> once said: “Life was
earnest in its beliefs, stormy in its ambition, hearty in its
sports.” There is a funny story going the rounds in these
“degenerate days” of a disciple of Peter Cartwright, who
resisted a western rough’s invitation to drink and to fight.
The concluding remark of the bully, as he picked himself
out of the elder bushes, was, in the tones of a deeply-deceived
man: “What do you come around here for, with a
long face on, saying you ‘never have fun with the boys,’
when you are chock full of fun? You’ve nearly broke my
back.” In this contest the champions of religion and of
“fun” were arrayed against each other, but it was the advantage
of the old crusaders that both religion and “fun”
lay in the same direction.</p>

<p>The chief of those romantic bruisers, King Richard Cœur
de Lion, is thus practically described by Charles Dickens:
“He was a strong, restless, burly man, with one idea always
in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of
breaking the heads of other men.” Anyway, the crusades
were the great safety-valve of Europe for surplus religious
zeal and pugnacity, and a great relief they proved to the
people who stayed at home, as Motley and Prof. Fiske have
splendidly argued. Richard sought this outlet for his
“idea.”</p>

<p>His career in the Holy Land was romantically ferocious.
He was, indeed, so impatient to get to business that he
fought two or three battles with Christians on the way.
He showed but one redeeming trait, brute courage; and a
historian declares that the Saracen Saladin shows as the
Christian statesman, and Richard as the fighting barbarian
in these crusades. He was far more considerate of his
Saracen prisoners than of his own soldiers, and treated the
Mohammedan leaders with more chivalry than he did the
allied kings and dukes. His hot temper and overbearing
manner really defeated the crusade, for it drove every
other prince and general home in anger. The Duke of
Austria, for instance: The walls of Ascalon had to be
hastily repaired to repel an assault, but the Duke held back
from manual labor, saying he “was no stone mason.”
Whereupon King Richard incontinently kicked his Grace
till he went to work.</p>

<p>The crusade collapsed. Richard heard that his amiable
brother John, encouraged by the angry King of France,
was plotting his deposition, and he started for home, undismayed
by the fact that he had not a friend left on the
continent, and must needs cross hostile territory to reach
England. His accustomed luck and pluck seem to have
deserted him, for he was cast ashore in Austria, and he
tried to skulk through the booted Duke’s dominions in
disguise. And so this proud, grand hero of a hundred
fights was captured in an inn kitchen, attired like a scullion,
wrestling with pots and pans—was Richard of the
Lion Heart. He was buried in a rocky dungeon, high
above the Rhine, and for months no one in England knew
what had become of him.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Richard owed his discovery and consequent
deliverance, not to his own courage, wit, or influence,
but to his ability to write songs and sing them. One of his
ballads he had taught to a friend named Blondel and Blondel
now went troubadouring through Europe, singing a verse
of the song under the windows of every dungeon and castle.
He was at length relieved to hear the second stanza of the
verse trolled, or, perhaps, roared through the bars. The
secret was out, but Richard was not. The Duke of Austria
and the Emperor of Germany now went into partnership,
trading on the expected ransom of the royal prisoner—offering
him to the highest bidder. Avarice proved a worse
obstacle than hatred to his release. His brother John and
Philip of France promised his captors more money to keep
him, or to deliver him to them, than they might get from
England for his release, and so he lingered in jail for fourteen
months, while friends and enemies were competitively
striving to get together the price of his release or his
destruction. During this time Richard busied himself
composing verses lamenting his lot, and sighing for freedom
and “fun,”—the most profitable and least discreditable
portion of his career, for the verses were very good.</p>

<p>For all this time we have the following picture of affairs
in England:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently
miserable. John was strengthening his own faction in the kingdom,
of which he proposed to dispute the succession. His own character
being light, profligate, and perfidious, John easily attached to his
person and faction not only all who had reason to dread the resentment
of Richard for criminal proceedings during his absence, but
also the numerous class of ‘lawless resolutes,’ whom the crusades
had turned back on their country, accomplished in the vices of the
East, impoverished in substance, hardened in character, and who
placed their hopes of harvest in civil commotion.</p>

<p>“To these causes of public distress and apprehension, must be
added the multitude of outlaws who, driven to despair by the oppression
of the feudal nobility and the severe exercise of the forest
laws, banded together in large gangs, and, keeping possession of the
forests and wastes, set at defiance the justice and magistracy of the
country. The nobles themselves, each fortified within his own castle,
and playing the petty sovereign over his own dominions, were
the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and oppressive than those of
the avowed depredators. Under the various burdens imposed by
this unhappy state of affairs, the people of England suffered deeply
for the present, and had yet more dreadful cause to fear for the future.</p>

<p>“Yet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the
rich, the vulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament,
which was the grand spectacle of the age, felt as much interested as
the half-starved citizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions
for his family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty
nor infirmity could keep youth or age from such exhibitions.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p></div>

<p>One of these exhibitions, the Tournament of Ashby, is
famous historically, and has been made the subject of one
of the finest word-pictures of the “Wizard of the North.”
In a natural amphitheater near the village of Ashby the
lists were enclosed with strong palisades, forming an oblong
space about a quarter of a mile in length, and half as broad.
At either end were strong wooden gates wide enough to admit
but two horsemen abreast; each of these gates guarded
by two heralds, attended by six trumpeters, six pursuivants
(messengers), and a strong body of horsemen. Around the
entrances the magnificent tents of knights, each of its
owner’s chosen color, surmounted by his pennon, his shield
and coat of arms hanging in front, his guards, retainers and
jester in gay livery contributing to the moving scene.
Back of these, refreshment tents and the quarters of farriers
and</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Around the circle were galleries, spread with tapestry for
the ladies and nobles, while extending up the slopes, and
even to the tops of the trees set thick about were the great
multitude of common people. On one side the royal seat
and canopy, occupied by Prince John and his brilliant retinue;
on the opposite a gayer gallery, and the throne of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Queen of Beauty and of Love, monarch of the hour and rewarder
of the victorious knights. This stand was brilliant
with the rich attire of the ladies and their pages—the
prevailing colors of the habits of the latter, as of the
throne, being green and pink. The traditional insignia of
Cupid shone all about on banner and shield—wounded
hearts, bleeding hearts, burning hearts, bows, quivers,
etc.</p>

<p>As the procession of contestants enters the arena, the
sound of wild, barbaric music rends the air—a mixture of
trumpets, cymbals, bells, and other instruments brought
back from the East by the crusaders. It is a goodly and at
the same time an anxious sight to behold so many gallant
champions, mounted bravely and armed richly, awaiting
the signal of encounter with the same ardor as their generous
steeds, neighing and pawing the ground. The knights
hold their long lances upright, their bright points glancing
in the sun, and the streamers with which they are decorated
fluttering over the plumage of their helmets. All is
ready; the heralds make proclamation of the conditions of
the tourney; the marshals of the field proclaim; the trumpets
sound; the signal words, <i>Laissez aller!</i> [French for
“Go!”] are shouted; spears drop to a horizontal, spurs are
sunk in the steeds, and fifty knights crash together in full
gallop. Anon the dust rises and the fight becomes visible;
we see half the knights dismounted, some not to rise, others
already on their feet fighting hand to hand with mace or ax
amid a struggling pile of disabled horses, wounded men,
broken spears and armor, the still mounted knights trampling
and fighting with swords, the crash of which on iron
helmets and shields makes an infernal din, over which roar
the shouts of the champions, and the more excited shouts
of the crazed spectators, the shriller encouragement of
ladies and the clang of trumpets. The splendid armor is
now defaced with dust and blood; the gay plumage, shorn
from the crests, drifts upon the breeze like snowflakes; all
the beautiful and graceful has disappeared, and what remains
ought only to awaken terror or compassion. But all,
including delicate and high bred ladies, cheer on the combatants;
while the heralds spur back and forth on the
borders of the <i>melee</i>, crying, “Fight on, brave knights!
man dies, but glory lives—death is better than defeat!
Fight on! for bright eyes behold your deeds!”</p>

<p>Now, at length, the combatants have thinned out until
only one knight is left on one side to meet three powerful
antagonists. It is fighting in earnest now, and Prince
John incites the three to the destruction of the one whom
he hates as a friend of the absent Richard. “The Disinherited
Knight” is sure to be overpowered. Suddenly a
voice like a trumpet-call sounds, “To the rescue!” and a
horseman in black armor, not yet seen in the fray, spurs
like a thunderbolt on the three. One is unhorsed in the
shock; another is cut down by the sword, the last falls
under his horse helpless, and the tournament is ended.</p>

<p>Eight knights were killed, upwards of thirty wounded,
several disabled for life. This is known in history as the
“Gentle and joyous Passage-at-Arms of Ashby.” “Hearty
in their sports,” were those old knights. They were
“chock full of fun.”</p>

<p>In the tumult of relieving the wounded, the knight of
the black armor disappeared, and could not be found to
receive the chaplet of honor. But a few minutes later
there was a commotion in Prince John’s pavilion. An unknown
messenger had placed a letter in his hands; it bears
the signet of the arms of France; it is from his confederate,
Philip, and it reads: “<i>Take heed to yourself! the devil is
loose!</i>”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked the courtiers.</p>

<p>“It means Richard is free and in England! We have
seen him. Let us away!”</p>

<p>It was so. The ransom, partly raised from English
loyalty and partly pledged by Richard’s faithful friends,
had been delivered to the captors, and the plot of John and
King Philip had failed. John fled to Normandy, and was
subsequently forgiven by his brother. “I will try to forget
my injuries as soon as John will forget my pardon,” said
Richard, sarcastically. This is the only case on record
where Cœur de Lion made the mistake of being too merciful.
If he had disposed of John, England would have
been saved from its worst king, but possibly might have
missed the advantage of the great charter of rights at
that time. But Richard took swift vengeance on King
Philip.</p>

<p>Richard had landed in England March 12, 1194. He remained
only two months, the rest of his reign, five years,
being spent on the continent “in his proper line of business”—fighting.
The two months were distinguished by
two things: his extortion from his subjects, and his famous
visit in the disguise of an abbott to Robin Hood, the merry
outlaw of Sherwood Forest. Popular ballads have it that
Richard indulged in a little “fun” with the doughty outlaw,
and was badly worsted; while sober history has it that the
lion-hearted king’s method of raising money “combined the
attributes of the tyrant and the swindler.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>” England had
already been impoverished by the enormous taxes to raise
the king’s ransom, and his return was the signal for fresh
exactions. He ordered the great seal to be broken, declared
the title to all property void, and required everybody
to take out new deeds and pay the price over again
for the affixing of the new seal. Ah, yes; “life was earnest
in those days, stormy in its ambition, hearty in its sports,”
and we ought to add, rascally in its administration. Government
is gentler and more refined now—is it more
honest?</p>

<p>The manner of Richard’s death was in as marked contrast
to the heroic character which poetry and romance
have given him, as were his capture, captivity and deliverance.
He was killed in Normandy in a sordid quarrel for
the possession of a pot of money which one of his knights
had found concealed in his castle—very much as if Alexander
the Great had met his death in a gambling-house row
over the stakes.</p>

<p>The vulgar and repulsive features of Richard Cœur de
Lion’s career did not detract at all from his character as a
hero in the days of chivalry. Indeed, the minstrels sang
admiringly of Richard’s atrocities: of how he supped gayly
on a fat Saracen baby when he could not get roast pig; and
caused a Saracen’s head to be roasted and served up to the
courtly ambassadors of Saladin; and butchered his prisoners
by the thousands. If the troubadours do not truly set
forth Richard’s achievements, they truly mirror the spirit
of chivalry in the imputed attributes of its most perfect
champion. Comparing the character of this lion-hearted
Plantagenet, as thus reflected, with that of Robin Hood,
the Saxon hero, as pictured in the popular ballads, we
must feel that the common people’s idea of manliness and
virtue, though personified in a bandit, was higher than
that of the Norman chivalry, and we justify Knight in
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The outlaw had the same attributes of bravery and generosity
with which the character of Richard the Lion Hearted has been invested,
without exhibiting those ferocious traits which belong to the
chivalric worship of mere brute courage and blind fanaticism.
The popular notion of a hero is the more refined one, although
Robin be merely ‘a good yeoman.’”</p>

<h2><a name="STUDIES_IN_ANCIENT_GREEK" id="STUDIES_IN_ANCIENT_GREEK">STUDIES IN ANCIENT GREEK
LIFE.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By J. P. MAHAFFY, A.M.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">General Features of the Greek Household.</span>—While
the citizen prized above all things his liberty and
his rights as a member of the state—a feeling which produced
in many cases a citizen democracy—this principle
was unknown within the household, in which he was a
despot, ruling absolutely the inferior members, who had no
legal grades except as distinguished into free and slaves.
The laws were very cautious about interfering with his
rights, and he was permitted to exercise much injustice
and cruelty without being punished. If in such a case he
was murdered by his dependants, the whole household of
slaves was put to death, unless the culprit was detected.
Nor could a household exist (except perhaps in Sparta)
without the master. If he died, his widow became again
the ward of her father or eldest brother, or son; and so
strongly was this sometimes felt that men on their death-beds
betrothed their wives to friends, who were likely to
treat them and their orphan children with kindness. Of
course clever women and servants often practically had
their own way, and ruled their lord or master; but the
theory of the Greek home was nevertheless always that of
an absolute monarchy, if not a despotism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lady of the House—Her Dress.</span>—There were
two distinct styles of female dress prevalent. The first was
the Dorian, which was noted for its simplicity. Unmarried
girls at Sparta often wore but a single light garment
(<i>chitonion</i>) fastened with clasps down the sides—a dress
much criticized by their neighbors. Over this was the
Doric <i>peplos</i>, fastened on the shoulders with clasps and
leaving the arms bare. The Ionians wore a long linen
chiton with sleeves, which reached down to the ground,
and over it a large flowing wrapper, fastened with a girdle,
worn high or low according to fashion; whereas the other
band called <i>strophion</i> was worn under the <i>chiton</i>, and
took the place of modern stays. As a general rule, unmarried
women confined their hairdressing to mere artistic
arrangement of the hair itself, while married women
wore bands, fillets, nets, and coronets. Dyeing the hair was
not uncommon, and the fashionable color was auburn, or
reddish fair hair. Women’s shoes were very carefully made,
and they carried fans and parasols, as may be seen in the
terra-cotta figures so common in our museums. Both sexes
wore rings, but in addition the women wore earrings, armlets,
and ankle-rings, generally of gold. These were the
ornaments against which lawgivers made enactments, and
which were forbidden or discouraged in days of trouble or
poverty. The ornaments of one rich lady are spoken of as
worth 50 minæ (about £195), a very large sum in those
days. The ordinary color of women’s dress was white, but
saffron cloaks, and even flowered patterns, are mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her Duties.</span>—The constant outdoor life of the Greek
gentleman, his many occupations in politics, and campaigns
in war, must have made a sensible wife even more
necessary than she is to modern men, and yet we do not
find that any Greeks valued her high qualities for these important
duties rightly except the Spartans. For among
them alone we find the mistress of the house a person of
real importance, appearing when she chooses in public, and
even offering an opinion which is respected on public
affairs. In cultivated Athens, on the contrary, she was
only taught spinning and cooking, and what rude medicine
might be wanting for the treatment of her household in
trifling illness. One of her main duties was always the
weighing out of wool to her women slaves, and her own
working at the loom. If a lady of the higher classes, she
was not supposed to appear to male visitors, but only saw
her lady friends and her nearest male relatives in her own
house. She seldom went out, except either to the funeral of
a near relation or to some religious procession and sacrifice.
Thus the liberty of women varied from a freedom as great
as need be in Sparta to a life of seclusion and neglect at
Athens. Other states may have held an intermediate position.
As for the vaunted dignity and liberty of ladies in
Homer, it is to be remarked that he speaks of the wives and
daughters of reigning princes, who probably retained the
same importance in historical Greece, wherever they were to
be found. For example, aristocratic ladies, such as Cimon’s
sister, Elpinice, were unrestrained, even at Athens, and
went where they chose. This was also the case everywhere
with the poor people, who could not afford to keep
their wives and daughters in the idleness and the restraint
unfortunately so fashionable in higher life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her Rights.</span>—In Homeric days we find the old barbarous
custom still surviving of buying a girl from her father
for a wife, and this was commonly done, unless the father
himself offered her as a compliment. The father, however,
usually gave her an outfit from the price he received for
her. In case of a separation this outfit came back to the
father, but he was also obliged to restore the price he had
received for his daughter. She does not appear to have had
any legal rights whatever. In later days the custom of
paying money was reversed, and the husband received
with his wife a dowry, which was regarded as common
property with his own, so long as she lived with him. In
case of separation or divorce, this dowry had to be repaid
to her father, and at Athens 18 per cent. was charged
upon it in case of delay in repayment. In many states to
marry a second wife during the life of the first was against
the practice, and probably the law, of the Greeks, but concubinage
was tolerated and even recognized by them,
though a married woman had at Athens a right to bring an
action for general ill-treatment against her husband, in
which she was obliged to appear and give evidence in person.
The dowry seems to have been partly intended as a
useful obstacle to divorce, which required its repayment,
but we find that heiresses made themselves troublesome by
their airs of importance, and this is referred to in Greek
literature, in which men are frequently advised not to
marry above them in wealth or connections. As all citizens
were considered equal in birth, and as marriages with
aliens were illegal and void, we do not hear of advice to
young men not to marry beneath them. To marry a poor citizen
girl was always considered a good deed, and is commended
as such.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedding Customs.</span>—Though marriage among the Greeks
was recognized thoroughly as a civil contract, for the purpose
of maintaining the household, and raising citizens for
the state, yet a religious solemnity was considered by them
not less essential to its dignity than by us, and though this
ceremony was not performed by an official priest, it consisted
in prayers and offerings to the gods who presided over
marriage. These were generally Zeus, Hera, Aphrodite,
and Artemis, but many local fashions existed. So also the
full moon and the winter season were generally but not
everywhere preferred. A bath in the most sacred water of
the district was thought necessary before the union, by way
of purification. Omens were carefully observed, and votive
offerings dedicated to the gods. The preliminaries closed
with a solemn sacrifice and feast combined, at which the
bride was present, closely veiled, with her female friends.
This was often a large dinner party, for we find laws restricting
the number to thirty, and complaints of the bad
taste of much display. She was then brought in solemn
procession late in the evening to her husband’s house, generally
on a carriage, with the bridegroom and his best man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
sitting on either side of her. Both were covered with garlands
and perfumed, while the Hymenæus or marriage song
was sung by the company to the sound of harps and flutes.
The bride’s mother had the special duty of carrying a torch
behind the carriage, while the bridegroom’s mother received
them torch in hand at his door. The bride brought with
her some household utensils, and was presented with others,
and with sweetmeats, on her arrival. The next morning
the married pair separated for a day (<i>apaulia</i>), and the
bridegroom slept at the house of his father-in-law, when
the bride sent him a present of a garment. Then only the
young couple were to receive their friends, who offered congratulations
and wedding-presents, which were called <i>anakalupteria</i>,
because the bride unveiled herself to her friends
on that day. Such were the general customs of a Greek
marriage, but many old and rude habits survived in various
places. Of these the most primitive was that of Sparta,
where the bridegroom pretended to carry off his bride by
violence, and visited her secretly for some time even after
his marriage. This marriage by capture is still common
among savages, and points to a ruder state of life than the
marriage by purchase, which was common in Homer’s
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Birth and Treatment of Infants.</span>—When a
child was born in the house, it was usual in Attica, and
probably elsewhere also, to hang a wreath of olive in case
of a boy, a fillet of wool in case of a girl, over the door.
This served as an announcement to friends and neighbors.
Greek law permitted the parents absolutely to dispose of it
as their property, and there was no provision against exposing
it, which was often done in case of girls, in order to
avoid expense. These exposed children if found and brought
up, became the slaves of the finder. But on the other hand,
the laws showed special favor to the parents of large families.
If a child was not exposed, there followed on the fifth
day a solemn purification of all the people in the house,
and on the seventh a sacrifice, when the relations assembled
and the child was named, generally after parents and
grand-parents, sometimes by reason of special wants or
fancies—in fact on the same principles which we follow in
christening our children. There is no evidence until the
later Macedonian times that birthday feasts were held
yearly; and Epicurus’ direction that his should be kept after
his death was thought very peculiar. Children of rich
people were often nursed by hired nurses—an employment
to which respectable Athenian citizens were reduced in the
hard times at the end of the Peloponnesian war. But a
Lacedæmonian nurse was specially valued, and often
bought at a great price among prisoners, as they were famed
for bringing up the child without swaddling-clothes, and
making him hardy and courageous. The Greeks used cradles
for children as we do, and gave them honey as we do
sugar, and the nurses represented on the vases are distinguished
by a peculiar kerchief on the head, as they often are
in our day by a cap or national costume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of Toys and Games for Children.</span>—As might be expected,
the inventive genius of the Greeks showed itself in
the constructing of all manner of toys, and children devised
for themselves perhaps all the games now known and many
more besides. Aristotle says you must provide them with
toys, or they will break things in the house, and the older
philosopher Archytas was celebrated for inventing the
child’s rattle. Plato also complains of the perpetual roaring
of younger, and the mischievousness of older, children.
We may infer from these things that the Greek boys were
fully as troublesome as our own. They had balls, hoops,
swings, hobbyhorses, and dice, with dolls for the girls, and
various animals of wood and earthenware, like the contents
of our Noah’s arks. They played hide and seek, blind man’s
buff, French and English, hunt the slipper, the Italian
<i>morra</i>, and many other games which the scholiasts and
Germans have in vain endeavored to explain. But for
grown people, we do not find many games, properly speaking,
played for the game’s sake, like our cricket. There was
very simple ball-playing, and, of course, gambling with dice.
Of gymnastic exercises I will speak separately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greek Education Generally.</span>—As for the girls of the
house, they were brought up to see and hear as little as possible.
They only went out upon a few state occasions, and
knew how to work wool and weave, as well as to cook. We
may fairly infer that the great majority of them could not
read or write. The boys, on the contrary, were subjected to
the most careful education, and on no point did the Greek
law-givers and philosophers spend more care than in the
proper training, both physical and mental, of their citizens.
The modern system, however, of public school training was
not practiced anywhere save at Sparta, where a state schoolmaster
(<i>paidonomos</i>) was appointed, and all the Spartan
boys taken out of the control of their parents. They lived
together under the care of elder boys, as well as masters, so
that the system of monitors, and even that of fagging, was
in ordinary practice. They were encouraged to fight out
their disputes, and were much given to sports and athletic
amusements, just like our schoolboys. But the public
school training and discipline lasted much longer at Sparta
than among us, and embraced the university period, as well
as the school period, of life.</p>

<p>In the other states of Greece, which were chiefly towns, or
suburbs of towns, the system of day schools was universal,
and the boys went to and from home under the charge of a
special slave, chosen because he was no longer fit for hard
work. He was called the boy’s leader, or pedagogue (<i>paidagogos</i>),
a word which never meant schoolmaster among
the Greeks, though it is so rendered in our English Bible
(Gal. iii. 24). The discipline of boys was severe, and they
were constantly watched and repressed, nor were they allowed
to frequent the crowded market place. Corporal punishment
was commonly applied to them, and the quality
most esteemed in boys was a blushing shyness and modesty,
hardly equalled by the girls of our time. Nevertheless
Plato speaks of the younger boys as the most sharp-witted,
insubordinate, and unmanageable of animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of Schools and Schoolmasters.</span>—It does not seem
that the office of schoolmaster was thought very honorable,
except of course in Sparta, where he was a sort of Minister
of Education. It was, as with us, a matter of private speculation,
but controlled by police regulations that the school
should open and close with sunrise and sunset and that no
grown men should be allowed to go in and loiter there. The
infant-school teachers, who merely taught children their
letters (<i>grammatodidaskolos</i>), were of a low class in society,
sometimes even teaching in open air, like the old hedge
schoolmasters in Ireland. The more advanced teaching of
reading and writing was done by the <i>grammatikos</i>, whose
house was called, like that of philosophers and rhetoricians,
<i>schole</i>, a place of leisure. For the physical and the æsthetic
side we have still to mention the trainer (<i>paidotribes</i>) and
the teacher of music (<i>kitharistes</i>), the former of whom taught
in the palæstra the exercises and sports afterward carried on
by the full-grown citizens in the gymnasia, which were a
feature in all Greek towns. The teachers of riper youth
stood in social position above the mere teachers of letters,
but beneath the professors of rhetoric and philosophy
(sophists). These latter performed the functions of college
tutors at our universities, and completed the literary side of
Greek education. The fees paid to the various teachers were
in proportion to their social importance. Some of the sophists
made great fortunes, and exacted very high fees; the
mere schoolmasters are spoken of as receiving a miserable
pittance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of what they Taught.</span>—The Greeks never thought of
making foreign languages a matter of study, and contented
themselves with learning to read and write their own. In
so doing the schoolmasters used as text-books the works
of celebrated epic or elegiac poets, above all Homer, and
then the proverbial philosophy of Hesiod, Solon, Phocylides,
and others, so that the Greek boy read the great classics of
his language at an early age. He was required to learn
much of them by heart, especially when books were scarce;
and his teacher pointed out the moral lessons either professedly
or accidentally contained in these poets. Thus they
stood in the place of our Bible and hymns in education. All
this was <i>grammatike</i>, which with music and gymnastics,
made up the general education of the Greeks. It excluded
the elementary arithmetic of our “three R’s,” and included
what they do not, a gentlemanly cultivation in music and
field sports. It is very doubtful whether swimming was included,
though Herodotus speaks of the Greeks generally as
being able to swim. There is, however, evidence that from
the fourth century B. C. onwards both elementary geometry
and arithmetic, and also drawing, were ordinarily
taught.</p>

<p>As regards music every Greek boy (like modern young
ladies) either had or was supposed to have a musical ear,
and he was accordingly taught either the harp or the flute,
and with it singing. Here again the lyric poems of the
greatest poets were taught him, and the Greek music always
laid the greatest stress on the words. Aristotle and
others complain that amateurs were spending too much
time on the practising of difficult music, and we know
from the musical treatises preserved to us that the Greeks
thought and taught a great deal more about musical theory
and the laws of sound than we do. The Greek tunes preserved
are not pleasing, but we know that they used the
strictest and most subtle principles in tuning instruments,
and understood harmony and discord as well as we do.
Great Athenians, like Cimon, were often able to sing and
accompany themselves on the harp, or lyre as we should
rather call it. The Greeks laid great stress on the moral
effects of music, especially as regards the performer, and
were very severe in their censure of certain styles of music.
They distinguished their scales as <i>modes</i>, and are said to
have put far greater stress on keys than we do, calling
some manly and warlike (Dorian), others weak and effeminate,
or even immoral (Mixo-Lydian). The modern Chinese
have the same beliefs about the moral effects of music. The
Greeks had their keynote in the middle of the scale, and
used chiefly the minor scale of our music. They had different
names and signs for the notes of the various octaves
which they used, and also different signs for vocal and for
instrumental music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gymnastics.</span>—Among the various exercises taught were
those in fashion in the public contests in the games—throwing
the discus, running, and wrestling, and those of use in
war—throwing the dart, managing the sword and shield,
and riding. Boxing was not highly esteemed, and seems
not to have been properly understood by the Greeks, who
would have had no chance against an English prize-fighter.
The severest contest was the <i>pancration</i>, where the combatants,
who were naked and unarmed, were allowed to use any
violence they liked to overcome their adversary. It was
therefore a combination of boxing, wrestling, and kicking,
with occasional biting and gouging by way of additional resource.
We hear of a wonderful jumping feat by Phayllus
of Croton, who leaped forty-four feet; but as he probably
jumped down-hill, and used artificial aids, we can not be
sure that it was more than can be done now-a-days. The
Spartans specially forbad boxing and the pancration, because
the vanquished was obliged to confess his defeat and
feel ashamed; and they did not tolerate professional trainers.
All the special exercises for developing muscle practised
in our gymnasia seem to have been known, and they
were all practised naked, as being sunburnt was highly
valued. The Greeks smeared themselves first with oil and
then with sand before their exercises, and cleaned themselves
with a scraper or <i>strigil</i>, or in later days by taking a
bath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Customs on Coming of Age.</span>—Most Greek states seem
to have wished to free young men as soon as possible from
the control of their parents. Hence, having passed the age
of boyhood, when they were called children (<i>paides</i>), they
were made <i>epheboi</i>, or “men of age,” at the age of sixteen
or eighteen, when they were enrolled solemnly in the list
of citizens. This was done at Athens with a religious service,
and with a solemn oath on the part of the youth, who
declared his allegiance to the laws and to the religion of
his city, and promised to defend it against all enemies and
seditions. He was then enrolled on the list of his deme or
parish, and this roll was called <i>the lexiarchikon grammateion</i>.
He was then competent to join in debate at the assembly,
to plead in court, to marry, and perform all the duties
of citizenship. It is not clear how he stood as regards
his father, except that, if the latter became unable to manage
his affairs, the son could have him so declared by an action
in court, and so become the owner during his father’s
life. Before the young men settled down, they were employed
for two years in outlying garrison duty and in patrolling
the frontiers of the land, during which time they
were called <i>peripoloi</i>. This gave them the necessary training
for war, and made them acquainted with the bounds
of their country. Many remains of these frontier forts
which were once garrisoned by the youth of Athens still
survive in Attica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Servants of the House.</span>—These were of course
slaves, with the exception of some field laborers, and of
nurses in times of depression and distress, when some free
women went out for hire. To these cases we may add the
cook, who was not an inmate of the house before the Macedonian
time, but was hired for the day when wanted for a
dinner party. All the rest were slaves, and were very numerous
in every respectable household. The principal sorts
of servants were as follows: There was a general steward, a
butler who had charge of the store-room and cellar, a marketing
slave, a porter, baking and cooking slaves for preparing
the daily meals, an attendant upon the master in his
walks, and this was an indispensable servant, a nurse, an
escort for the children, and a lady’s maid. In richer houses
there was also a groom or mule-boy. This list shows a sub-division
of labor more like the habits of our East-Indian
families than those of ordinary households in England. I
have spoken above of the purchasing and value of these
slaves. If faithful, they were often made free, especially by
the will of their master on his death-bed, but they did not
become citizens. They remained in the position of resident
aliens under the patronage of their former master or his representatives.</p>

<p>In proportion as the free population of Greece diminished
the freeing of slaves became more and more common, until
it actually appears to have been the leading feature in the
life of the small towns. Thousands of inscriptions recording
this setting free of individual slaves are still found, and on
so many various stones, even tombstones, that it almost appears
as if material for recording had failed them by reason
of the quantity of these documents. The same increase of
liberation was a leading feature in the Roman empire, but
there the freedman obtained the right and position of a citizen,
which was not the case in Greece. The most enlightened
moralists of both countries exhorted benevolence toward
slaves, and the frequent freeing of them as the duty of
humane masters, but none of these writers ever dreamt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
total abolishing of slavery, which they all held to be an institution
ordained by nature. This seems also the view of
the early Christian writers, who nowhere condemn the principle
of slavery as such.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Domestic Animals.</span>—These were first the horses and
mules, which do not seem to have been treated with any
great familiarity, but were carefully groomed, and after exercise
were allowed to roll in sand before being brought in—a
treatment still common in southern Italy, where the old
Greek fashion of driving four-in-hand abreast also prevails.
The two center horses were yoked to the pole, the others
were fastened by loose traces, and called <i>paraseiroi</i> (outriggers).
The commonest and most valued domestic animal
was the dog, which maintains a very important place
in Greek society up to the present day. There were various
kinds of breeds for hunting, chosen both for nose and for
speed; there were watch-dogs; and also ornamental kinds,
such as little lap-dogs, which are represented in the sad
scenes of leave-taking on the tombs. Many anecdotes are
told of their faithfulness, and we hear of at least one case
where a handsome dog, which belonged to Alcibiades cost
about 70<i>l.</i> Cats were also common, so common as to be
charged with the breaking of household ware by guilty servants,
and they are often described as wandering along the
roofs of houses. Sundry birds were kept in cages, and for
ornament, such as pheasants and peacocks; the quail was
used for combats corresponding to English cock fights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Customs of Burial.</span>—I will conclude our consideration
of the Greek household by describing the customs when
death laid its hand upon one of the inmates.</p>

<p>At the moment of the death struggle the face was veiled,
that no man might see it; then it was uncovered for a moment
to close his eyes and mouth. The body was then
washed by female relatives, scented with unguents, dressed
in white and with a garland, and placed upon a couch
adorned with branches, and with an unguent bottle beside
it. This laying out was done in the entrance hall of the
house and the feet were turned to the door. Outside was a
cypress branch and water for sprinkling those who came
out, as the dead defiled the house and its inmates. The laying
out was limited to one day, during which both male and
female relatives, together with hired mourners, stood round
the bier, and uttered laments in refrain very like the <i>Irish
cry</i> of our day. This almost universal custom in Asia was
discountenanced and restricted by Greek law-givers, especially
the tearing of the hair and laceration of the face
which accompanied it. Burial took place in the morning
dawn, before the sun could shine upon the corpse; in later
days a small coin was placed in his mouth to pay his passage
in the nether world—a custom which still survives in
some parts of Greece. In the funeral procession the male
relatives went before, the female followed after, and in
Athens and other places where women lived secluded, only
aged women and near relatives were allowed to attend, as
young men took this opportunity of seeing the ladies, who
were at other times invisible. When the dead was laid in
the tomb, he was called by name aloud, and farewell was
bidden him. There was afterward a funeral feast, and offerings
at the tomb, but the time of mourning and of wearing
black or gray garments was short; in Sparta twelve days, at
Athens a month; at Ceos, exceptionally, a mother mourned
her growing son for a whole year. Praising speeches were
not delivered over private persons as at Rome, but only in
the case of a public funeral, such as that of the bones of the
dead who had fallen in battle, and were burned on the battle
field. These ashes were brought home in urns, and
treated as the corpses of the dead would have been at home.
The burning of the dead, though known early, and often
practiced in war and travel, was decidedly the exception.
To cast earth upon the dead was of the last importance, and
even when the body could not be found an empty grave received
the due honors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sepulchral Monuments.</span>—In the oldest times the dead
were buried in their own ground, and close beside the house
they had occupied. Afterward the burying of the dead
within the walls of cities was forbidden except in the case
of great public benefactors, who were worshipped as heroes
and had a shrine set over them. The rest were buried in
the fairest and most populous suburb, generally along both
sides of the high road, as at Athens and at Syracuse, where
their tombs and the inscriptions occupied the attention of
everyone that passed by. The oldest and rudest monuments
placed over the tomb were great mounds of earth, then
these mounds came to be surrounded by a circle of great
stones; afterward chambers were cut underground in the
earth or rock, and family vaults established. Handsome
monuments in marble, richly painted and covered with
sculpture, were set up over the spot. These monuments
sometimes attained a size almost as great as a temple. The
scenes sculptured on the marble were from the life and occupation
of the deceased, more often parting scenes, where
they were represented taking leave of their family and
friends, nor do we possess any more beautiful and touching
remains of Greek life than some of these tombs.
In the chamber of the dead many little presents, terra-cotta
figures, trinkets and vases were placed, nay, in early times
favorite animals, and even slaves or captives were sacrificed
in order to be with him; for the Greeks believed that though
the parting with the dead was for ever, he still continued to
exist, and to interest himself in human affairs and in pursuits
like those of living men. The crowded suburbs where
the tombs were placed were generally ornamented with trees
and flowers, and were a favorite resort of the citizens. The
dead bodies of executed criminals were either given back to
their relatives or, in extreme cases, cast into a special place,
generally some natural ravine or valley hidden from view
and ordinary thoroughfare. Here the executioner dwelt,
who was generally a public slave. This place was called
<i>barathrum</i> at Athens, and <i>Ceadas</i> at Sparta.</p>

<h4><a id="HAVING_DOING_AND_BEING"></a>HAVING, DOING, AND BEING.</h4>

<p class='center'>By JAMES MARTINEAU.</p>

<p>Some men are eminent for what they <i>possess;</i> some for
what they <i>achieve;</i> others for what they <i>are</i>. <i>Having, doing,
and being</i>, constitute the three great distinctions of
mankind, and the three great functions of their life. And
though they are necessarily all blended, more or less, in
each individual, it is seldom difficult to say which of them
is prominent in the impression left upon us by our fellow
man.</p>

<p>In every society, and especially in a country like our
own, there are those who derive their chief characteristic
from what they <i>have;</i> who are always spoken of in terms
of revenue; and of whom you would not be likely to think
much, but for the large account that stands on the world’s
ledger in their name. In themselves, detached from their
favorite sphere, you would notice nothing wise or winning.
At home, possibly, a dry and withered heart; among associates
a selfish and mistrustful talk; in the council, a style
of low ignoble sentiments; at church, a formal, perhaps an
irreverent, dullness betray a barren nature, and offer you
only points of repulsion, so far as humanities are concerned;
and you are amazed to think that you are looking on the
idols of the exchange. Their greatness comes out in the
affairs of bargain and sale, to which their faculties seem
fairly apprenticed for life. If they speak of the past, it is in
memory of its losses and its gains; if of the future, it is to
anticipate its incomings and investments. The whole
chronology of their life is divided according to the stages of
their fortunes, and the progress of their dignities. Their
children are interesting to them principally as their heirs;
and the making of their will fulfils their main conception
of being ready for their death. And so completely do they
paint the grand idea of their life on the imagination of all
who know them, that when they die, the mammon-image
can not be removed, and it is the fate of the money, not of
the man, of which we are most apt to think. Having put
vast prizes in the funds, but only unprofitable blanks in
the admiration and the hearts of us, they leave behind nothing
but their <i>property;</i> or, as is expressively termed, their
“<i>effects</i>,”—the thing which they caused, the main result of
their having been alive. How plain is it that we regard
them merely as <i>instruments of acquisition;</i> centers of attraction
for the drifting of capital; that they are important
only as indications of commodities; and that their human
personality hangs as a mere label upon a mass of treasure!
Every one must have met with a few instances in which
this character is realized, and with many in which, notwithstanding
the relief of some redeeming and delightful
features, it is at least approached. In proportion as this
aim, of possession, is taken to be paramount in life, length
of days must, no doubt, be deemed indispensable to the human
destination. The longer a man lies out at interest, the
greater must be the accumulation. If he is unexpectedly
recalled, every end which he suggested is disappointed;
the only thing he seemed fit for can not go on; he is a
power lost from this sphere, and incapacity thrust upon the
other; missed from the markets here, thrown away among
sainted spirits there. For himself, and for both worlds, the
event seems deplorable enough; and it is difficult to make
anything but confusion out of it. An imagination tacitly
filled with this conception of life as a stage prepared for
enjoyment and possession, must look on a term that is unfulfilled,
as on a broken tool, dropping in failure to the
earth.</p>

<p>Of those who have thus lived to accumulate and enjoy,
<i>history</i> is for the most part silent, having in truth nothing
to say. Not doing the work, or joining in the worship of
life, but only feasting at its table, they break up and drive
off into oblivion as soon as the lights are out and the wine
is spilt. Belonging entirely to the present, they never appear
in the past; but sink with the weight of wealth in the
dark gulf;—unless perchance some Crœsus the rich is fortunate
enough to fall into association with Solon the wise.
There are no historical materials in simple animal existence,
nor is the mere sentient being of a man, considered as
the successful study of comfort, and receptacle of happiness.</p>

<p>History is constructed by a second or nobler class, those
who prove themselves to be here, not that they may have,
but that they may <i>do;</i> to whom life is a glorious hour; and
who are so seen not to work that they may rest, but only
to rest that they may work. No sooner do they look
around them with the open eye of reason and faith, upon
the great field of the world, than they perceive that it must
be for them a battle-field; and they break up the tents of
ease, and advance to the dangers of lonely enterprise and
the conflict with splendid wrong. Strong in the persuasion
that this is a God’s world, and that his will must rule it by
royal right, they serve in the severe campaign of justice;
asking only for the wages of life, and scorning the prizes of
spoil and praise. Wherever you find such, whether in the
field, in the senate, or in private life, you see the genuine
type of the heroic character,—the clear mind, the noble
heart, indomitable will, pledged all to some arduous and
unselfish task; and whether it be the achievement, with
Cobden, of freedom of pacific commerce between land and
land; or, with Clarkson, of freedom of person between man
and man; or, with Cromwell, of freedom of worship between
earth and heaven; the essential feature is in all instances
the same; the man holds himself as the mere instrument
of some social work; commits himself in full
allegiance to it; and spends himself wholly in it. They
“have a baptism to be baptized with; and how are they
straitened, till it be accomplished!” During the glorious
conflict of such lives it is impossible not to look on with
breathless interest. Once possessed of their great design,
we watch its development with eager eye and beating
heart. And if, early in the day, they are struck down, we
clasp our hands in sudden anguish, and a cry goes up that
the field is lost. And though this despair is a momentary
loss of the true faith; though God never fails to rally the
forces of every good cause that has mustered for battle on
the earth; yet, no doubt, the victory in such a case is deferred;
the plan is broken off; the painful sense of a suspended
work, that might have been finished, remains upon
survivors’ hearts. On behalf of the noble actors themselves,
indeed, we have no embarrassment of faith; there
is that within them which may well find a home in more
worlds than one, and meet a welcome wherever Almighty
Justice reigns. We are not ashamed, as with the man of
mere possession, to follow them into the higher transitions
of their being, and knock for them at the gate of better
spheres. But there appears something untimely and deplorable
in the providence of the world they quit. The
fruit has not been permitted to ripen ere it dropped. The
great function of their life required time for its fulfilment;
and time has been denied. Their beneficent action was
wholly through the energies of their living will; and these
energies are laid for us in unseasonable sleep. And thus,
while we are ashamed at the grave of the epicurean, we
weep over the departure of the hero.</p>

<p>But there is a life higher than either of these. The <i>saintly</i>
is beyond the heroic mind. To <i>get</i> good, is animal; to <i>do</i>
good, is human; to <i>be</i> good is divine. The true use of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
man’s possessions is to help his work; and the best end of
all his work, is to show us what he is. The noblest workers
of our world bequeath us nothing so great as the image
of themselves. Their task, be it ever so glorious, is historical
and transient; the majesty of their spirit is essential and
eternal. When the external conditions which supplied the
matter of their work have wholly decayed from the surface
of the earth, and become absorbed in its substance, the perennial
root of their life remains, bearing a blossom ever
fair, and a foliage ever green. And while to some, God
gives it to show themselves through their work, to others
he assigns it to show themselves without even the opportunity
of work. He sends them transparent into this world;
and leaves us nothing to gather and infer. Goodness,
beauty, truth, acquired by others, are original to them, hiding
behind the eye, thinking on the brow, and making
music in the voice. The angels appointed to guard the issues
of the pure life seem rather to have taken their station
at its fountains, and to pour into it a sanctity at first. Such beings
live imply <i>to express themselves;</i> stand between heaven
and earth, and meditate for our dull hearts. With fewer
outward objects than others, or at least with a less limited
practical mission devoting them to a fixed task, their life is
a soliloquy of love and aspiration; the soul not being with
them, the servant of action, but action rather the needful
articulation of the soul. Not, of course, that they are, in
the slightest degree, exempt from the stern and positive obligations
of duty, or licensed, any more than others, to
dream existence away. If once they fall into this snare,
and cease to work, the lineaments of beauty and goodness
are exchanged for those of shame and grief. Usually they
do not <i>less</i>, but rather <i>more</i>, than others; only under somewhat
sorrowful conditions, having spirits prepared for what
is more than human, and being obliged to move within
limits that are only human. The worth of such a life depends
little on its <i>quantity;</i> it is an affair of <i>quality</i> alone.
These highest ends of existence have but slight relation to
time. Years can not mellow the love already ripe, or purify
the perceptions already clear, or lift the aspiration that already
enters heaven.</p>

<h4><a id="THE_GOODNESS_OF_A_GOOD_MAN"></a>THE GOODNESS OF A GOOD MAN.</h4>

<p class='center'>By ALEXANDER McLAREN, D. D.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith.”—Acts
xi: 24.</p></div>

<p>You remember how once a young man came to Jesus,
with much beautiful youthful purity in his life and youthful
enthusiasm in his heart, and in his eager way, prefaced
his question with a lightly-uttered “Good Master.” Christ
answered by trying to make him feel how much more the
word meant than he had ever seen. “Why callest thou me
good?” said he, not thereby rejecting the term for himself,
but setting the youth to ponder its deep meaning. And
whenever we have learned to feel “how awful goodness is,”
we shall be ready to listen to Jesus saying further: “None is
good but one, that is God.” By that saying he neither
means to deny his own goodness nor that of men who will
take up their cross and follow him, but only to remind the
light-hearted inquirer, who was so ready with his conventional
bestowment of the epithet, and so eager to know
what he was to do for eternal life, that there was one source—and
only one—-of goodness, and, therefore, that the only
way to be good was to have our emptiness replenished by
his fullness.</p>

<p>A good man, then, is a man who draws his goodness from
God, the source of all goodness. He himself is the type of
all perfection, the home of all things fair. Whatsoever
things are lovely and whatsoever things are venerable—all
that we call virtue, all to which hearts and consciences ascribe
praise—dwell in God as in their native home. In the
abyss of his being the streams of goodness, which part into
many heads to fertilize the wilderness and sweeten the salt
marshes of human nature, rest undivided. He is the reality
of which all our conceptions of goodness are but the fragmentary
representations, the substance of which they are
but shadows. Not only so, but as all life is an effluence
from him with whom alone is the fountain of life, and as it
is his light in which we see light, so all the goodness which
is in men is from above, and cometh down from the Father
of Light. All light and heat are from the sun, and all goodness
is of God. All virtues are radiations from him. “They
are but broken lights of thee.” He alone is good of himself
and by himself. Drawing his being from none, he
owes his character to none, to no outward helps or occasions
his actions, to no importation his beauty. Receiving from
none, he gives to all, and every deed of fair goodness that
man has ever done, at the last analysis, has been to the
doer no less than to the beholders or the hearers the gift of
God.</p>

<p>He would not be good unless he delighted in bestowing
himself. Goodness is communicative, and all love has its
chiefest delight in giving away itself. As the sun “rejoices
to run his race,” and as it is the very nature and property
of light to radiate, and of gases to diffuse themselves, so
he can not be stayed nor sealed up, but rejoices to impart.
And, certainly, there can be nothing in God which he so
much delights to bestow as his goodness, since it is that in
which most chiefly do we bear his image, and by which we
are most closely knit to him. His highest purpose concerning
us all is “that we should be partakers of his holiness.”
Happiness, wisdom, life itself, all in some measure
and fashion, offshoots from his own, he delights to give; but
these are but means to an end, and thus moral likeness to
himself is his aim in all his other gifts. God had rather
have us good than great, and makes us sometimes glad and
sometimes heavy that by both we may be made to desire,
and so be able to receive, more resemblance to himself in
holiness. This is the meaning of life. This is the dearest
desire of our Father for us.  This is the gift which he—the
infinite love—is ever longing to bestow on us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>This goodness, then, affords a presumption that he will
make us good. That is a profound word of the Psalmist’s
“Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will he teach
sinners in the way.” The more clearly we see the perfect
purity and goodness of God, the more conscious shall we
certainly be of our own unlikeness to him. But in that
discernment of his lustrous perfectness, and penitent recognition
of our own sinfulness, there lies hope, not despair.
We may be sure that he loves us too well to keep such sovereign
completeness to himself and leave his poor children
stumbling here in the mud and mire. What he is, he assuredly
will desire to make us, so far as it may be. He is
the “giving God” and the poorest and most impure of men
may be sure that God does desire to give him purity of
heart and life, and may lift up the hopeful and bold prayer,
“Thy spirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightness.”</p>

<p>Surely, too, it needs but little experience of life to feel
that, if we are ever to be made good, a divine power is
needed to do it. A very small amount of honest attempt to
mend our own characters might teach each of us that the
viper has got far too tight a hold on us for us to shake it into
the fire, and that its poison is in our blood. If you have
ever tried to cure a bad habit, you know how hard it is;
and some of us could tell how the sins that we loathe most
hold us in a grip none the looser because of our disgust at
them and ourselves, and, like a reefer’s knot, their cords
are tied the tighter by the pressure of our resistance against
them. It is as impossible for a man to make himself good,
in the deepest sense of the word, as it is for him to lift himself
by his own hand laid on his own collar. There
must be some power outside him to raise. God only can
strengthen us to cast out sin. God only can enlighten our
eyes to see lurking evil; he only can give energy to our
wills to root it up, though we drag bleeding fragments of
our hearts with it; he only can give the positive goodness
which is more than mere freedom from evil, and fill the
empty chamber with a guest strong enough to keep out the
returning demon and all his crew.</p>

<p>So his Holy Spirit is given to us, if we will, to make us
holy. We may, if we will, have that divine guest in our
inmost spirit, molding us anew, purging the fountains of
our will, enlightening our blindness, fixing our love on all
things pure and high, burning up all our evil, with which
in our own strength we have vainly fought, and kindling
in us a flame of self-forgetting love, in which, as in the
central fire of the earth, all the elements of the new nature
to be formed within us are molten together, ready to crystallize
into beauty like precious gems, or to consolidate into
strength like the granite mountains. Any man may, if he
will, be “full of the Holy Ghost”—as a vessel is filled with
precious elixir poured into it. Any man may, if he will,
have his whole nature influenced and inhabited by that
mighty spirit of whom we may all be the temples, and
which dwells in us not as the image of the god abides in
the shrine, but as our spirits animate our bodies, being
diffused through all our nature, the eye of our seeing, the
heart of our love, the will of our resolve, and in all of us the
source of our goodness, and the life of our better life. “If
any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”
Let us remember that this penetration of all our nature
with a divine spirit dwelling within us is <i>the</i> promise of
Christianity to every man. No mere love of God the
Father, even if it were brought to us in the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ would be enough without the communion
of the Holy Ghost. Calvary and Olivet are not sufficient
for our victory over sin without the upper room and
the rushing mighty wind. And let us not forget that the
spirit thus given to all Christians is the spirit of illumination
indeed, the spirit of power, rich in his seven-fold energies,
and the source of every endowment of mind and hand
and tongue and heart that we possess, but that his highest
and most universal office is to make us good, and his best
name the Holy Spirit. Let us court earnestly the best
gifts, but seek more earnestly still that gift which needs no
special capacity to receive nor any special circumstances to
exercise, but may be claimed by the poorest, and will ennoble
the loftiest. Let others seek for gifts; do you pray
for graces. Let who will be great, do you try to submit to
the working of the good Spirit who makes you good.</p>

<p>Our text carries the analysis a step farther, and shows
us how Barnabas came to be full of the Holy Ghost.
It gives us the <i>condition of goodness</i>. He was good because
he was full of the spirit, and he was full of the spirit because
he was full of faith. That is the final explanation of
his character.</p>

<p>The spirit of God dwells in a man through his faith. One
text speaks of “the Holy Ghost which they that believe on
him should receive,” and everywhere similar language is
held as to the connection between faith and the dwelling of
the spirit of goodness in our hearts. By the act of trust in
Christ, the Lord of the Spirit, we open our natures for the
entrance of the sanctifier, who ever waits to enter in. A
man has to shut his door and pull down his blinds to keep
the light out. If we open ever so minute a crevice, a beam
will come in, and the wider we open, the broader the stream
that pours in. So in our simple faith, we open the door
and there pour into our hearts the quickening energies of
that good spirit. The amount of our faith measures the
amount of our possession of the Spirit who makes us good.</p>

<p>Thus faith becomes the condition of goodness, because it
is the condition of the Spirit of God dwelling in us. It
brings us into contact with the electric battery, completes
the circuit, and as soon as the circuit is completed the
spark comes. It is also the condition of goodness, because
it implies self-oblivion and self-distrust, and is the opposite
of that self-regard which, as we have seen, is the root of all
evil. The germ of all holiness is in faith, not only because
it brings us under the operation of the divine power which
makes holy, but because it is itself the great antagonist of
selfishness.</p>

<p>So Christian morality is the very opposite of the practical
heathenism which lies at the bottom of so much of the
teaching of to-day. Trust thyself, say many voices—it is
the beginning of wisdom, strength, freedom. Distrust thyself
and trust Christ, says the Gospel—thereby alone wilt
thou be made pure and blessed. The Babel builders tried to
get up to the heavens by their own building. The Titans tried
to storm it by placing mountain on mountain, but “no
man hath ascended up to heaven.” Better for us to rise
thither by that ladder which now binds together heaven
and earth, even Jesus Christ, our brother and our Lord, by
whom all bright-winged angels of help and cleansing will
come to minister to us purity and joy, and by whom we at
last, perfected in goodness, shall pass into that presence, of
which the radiant purity would blast all that had one taint
of uncleanness.</p>

<p>Learn the conditions, then, on which you can be good.
No goodness without God’s Spirit—no Spirit without faith.
You can not make yourself better, can not hammer or pare
your own nature into purity and loveliness. But you can
put your confidence in Jesus Christ, who will take your nature
into his hands and mold it into a fairest likeness to
himself. You can trust him, who will breathe into you his
spirit to make you holy. If my epitaph is ever to be, “He
was a good man,” it must first be said, “He was full of the
Holy Ghost and of faith.” Let us give up the weary, hopeless
work of trying to make ourselves good, and yield ourselves
to him that he may make us like himself, and that
we may have a mightier power ever working in our natures
till they are full of beauty and “holy as God is holy.”</p>

<h4><a id="THE_CONFLICTS_OF_LIFE"></a>THE CONFLICTS OF LIFE.</h4>

<p class='center'>By <span class="smcap">Bishop EDWARD THOMSON</span>, D. D., LL. D.</p>

<p>1. We can not escape difficulty. The air is tainted, the
soil churlish, the ocean tempest tossed. Whether we are
in the field or in the wilderness, on Persian plains or Alpine
heights, amid equatorial heats, or temperate climes,
or polar solitudes, we are met by a thousand obstacles.
Earth is cursed, and everywhere she puts forth her thorn in
obedience to her Maker’s withering word. True, the curse
is tempered with the mercy which yields unnumbered
blessings to the hand of toil; nevertheless, it cleaves to all
earth’s surface, and turns the key upon her hidden treasures.
We read of cloudless skies, and sunny climes, and
fields which need naught but the sickle; but who finds
them? Paradise is always ahead of the emigrant.</p>

<p>Man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward; that is,
by a general law of nature. Hence we find it in want and
abundance, in toil and indolence, in indulgence and restraint,
in infancy, in manhood, and in age. It waits on
every pleasure, and every path, and every pursuit—it
dwells within. We can no more escape it than we can fly existence.
Take a few illustrations. A young man resolves
to be eminent. Entering the academy, he finds many difficulties
in algebra, and becoming discouraged he gives it
up; but has he liberated himself? No, he has plunged from
great to greater difficulties. How can he unlock the vaults
of mathematics without algebra, their only key? Does he
abandon mathematics, another difficulty seizes him. How
can he become educated without a knowledge of the exact
sciences? Does he relinquish his aim at scholarship? How
then, can he carry out his resolution to become eminent?
Will he rescind his resolution? Then challenge him to tame
the restless passions by which it was prompted. Like the
fabled ships of the ancients, “<i>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult
vitare Charybdim</i>”—he who endeavors to avoid Charybdis
is drawn into the jaws of Scylla. How many, because of
difficulties in their pursuits, become idlers? But who on
earth has more trouble than the idler? A man becomes religious,
and enters the path of life; but he soon finds that
the world opposes, that his passions demur, that his secular
plans come in conflict with his religious efforts, that an invisible
adversary stands in the path to contend every inch
of ground with him. He retreats. But now his difficulties
are ten thousand fold greater. He finds that an unseen footstep
treads upon his wandering heels, that an All-seeing
eye surveys his inmost soul, that an invisible hand writes
his guilt in characters indelible on all the objects around
him. He must encounter the stings of conscience, the upbraidings
of reason, the admonitions of the altar, the prayers
of Zion, the cross of his dying Christ, the intercession
of his risen Jesus, the moving, mellowing, subduing influences
of the divine Spirit, the ten thousand warnings of
a merciful Providence, the unnumbered monitions of living,
decaying, dying, reviving nature, the very sympathies of
heaven, yea, even the moving entreaties of her compassionate
king. The apostate deliberately contends with conscience,
reason, Providence, truth, Zion, men, angels, God;
and in addition to all these the enemies he had before, and
without a single auxiliary in earth, hell, or heaven! Verily,
he has gained.</p>

<p>2. Difficulties invigorate the soul. I do not mean the
difficulties of indolence and disobedience, these are withering
curses, but the difficulties of industry, of obedience.</p>

<p>They are conditions essential to strength. What gives
power to the arm of the smith? The weight of his hammer.
What gives swiftness to the Indian foot? The fleetness of
the game. Thus it is with the senses. What confers exquisite
sensibility upon the blind man’s ear? The curtain
which, by hiding the visible universe from his sight, compels
him to give intense regard to the most delicate vibrations
that play upon his tympanum. Thus it is with the intellect.
Who is the greatest reasoner? He who habitually
struggles with the worst difficulties that can be mastered by
reason. Some men have fruitless imaginations; but who are
they? Those who have never led their fancies out. The
genial oak planted in a dismal cellar, shut out from the
light and air of heaven, would not grow up and lift its
branches to the skies. Plant your imagination in the
heavens, and let it be subject to the high and holy influences
of its pure ether, and its silent lights, and it shall manifest
vitality, and vigor, and upward aspirations.</p>

<p>The memory, too, is strong, if subjected to proper exercise.
It will yield no revenue to the soul that does not tax it; and
just in proportion as it is taxed, will it be found to have capacity
of production. I will add that it is thus with the
moral powers. Envy, jealousy, anger, those bitter fountains
which so often tincture the streams of private and domestic
joy, deepen in proportion to the obstacles through
which they flow. Avarice and ambition, those demons that
have desolated the globe with war, derive their overwhelming
power from the difficulties which impede their progress.
The daring lover testifies that love becomes more
wild and resistless as great and romantic difficulties rise
around him. What makes the good Christian? Perpetual
trial. He who has experienced the severest storms, and has
most frequently thrown out the Christian anchor, has the
strongest hope. Where shall we expect the firmest faith?
At the gate of St. Peter’s? or at the martyr’s stake? Who
is compared to purified silver or gold? That Christian
around whose soul God hath kindled the fires of his furnace,
and kept them glowing till it reflected his own image.</p>

<p>Difficulties give a healthy tone and tendency to the powers.
As a body in a state of inaction becomes lethargic and
diseased, so the intellect, if not kept in vigorous exercise,
becomes enfeebled, and gradually sinks under the sway of
the passions. Energetic action is indispensable to preserve
both the body from disease, and the soul from the dominion
of sense.</p>

<p>3. Difficulties develop resources. To prove this it is only
necessary to cite the aphorism—necessity is the mother of
invention. She levels forests, she rears cities, she builds
bridges, she prostrates mountains, she lays her iron pathway
from river to river, and from sea to sea, she baffles the
raging elements, and extends her dominion from earth to
air and ocean, she ascends the heavens, and with fearless
foot treads round the zodiac.</p>

<p>4. There is scarce any difficulty that can not be overcome
by perseverance. Trace any great mind to its culmination,
and you will find that its ascent was slow, and by natural
laws, and that its difficulties were such only as ordinary
minds can surmount. Great results, whether physical or
moral, are not often the offspring of giant powers. Genius
is more frequently a curse than a blessing. Its possessor,
relying upon his extraordinary gifts, generally falls into
habits of indolence, and fails to collect the materials which
are requisite to useful and magnificent effort. But there is a
something which is sure of success; it is the determination
which, having entered upon a career with full conviction
that it is right, pursues it in calm defiance of all opposition.
With such a feeling a man can not but be mighty. Toil
does not weary, pain does not arrest him. Carrying a compass
in his heart, which always points to one bright star, he
allows no footstep to be taken which does not tend in that
direction. Neither the heaving earthquake, nor the yawning
gulf, nor the burning mountain can terrify him from his
course; and if the heavens should fall, the shattered ruins
would strike him on his way to his object. Show me the
man who has this principle, and I care not to measure his
blood, nor brains. I ask not his name nor his nation—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
pronounce that his hand will be felt upon his generation,
and his mind enstamped upon succeeding ages.</p>

<p>This attribute is God-like. It may be traced throughout
the universe. It has descended from the skies—it is the
great charm of angelic natures. It is hardly to be contemplated,
even in the demon, without admiration. It is this
which gives to the warrior his crown, and encircles his brow
with a halo that, in the estimation of a misjudging world,
neither darkness, nor lust, nor blasphemy, nor blood can
obscure. The bard of Mantua, to whose tomb genius in all
ages makes its willing pilgrimage, never presents his hero
in a more attractive light, than when he represents him,
“<i>tot volvere casus</i>,” rolling his misfortunes forward, as a
river bearing all opposition before it.</p>

<p>I am well satisfied that it is a sure passport to mental
excellence. Science has no summit too lofty for its ascent—literature
has no gate too strong for its entrance. The
graces collect around it, and the laurel comes at its bidding.
Talk not of circumstances. Repudiate forever that doctrine
so paralyzing, so degrading, and yet so general, “Man
is the creature of circumstances.” Rather adopt that
other sentiment, more inspiring to yourselves, more honorable
to your nature, more consonant with truth, Man the
architect of his own fortune. I grant that circumstances
have their influence, and that often this is not small; but
there are impulses within, to which things external are as
lava to the volcano. Circumstances are as tools to the
artist. Zeuxis would have been a painter without canvas;
Michael Angelo would have been a sculptor without marble;
Herschell would have been a philosopher without a telescope,
and Newton would have ascended the skies though
no apple had ever descended upon his head. One of the most
distinguished surgeons of modern times performed nearly
all the operations of surgery with a razor. West commenced
painting in a garret, and plundered the family cat for
bristles to make his brushes. When Paganini once rose to
amuse a crowded auditory with his music, he found that
his violin had been removed, and a coarse instrument substituted
for it. Explaining the trick, he said to the audience,
“Now I will show you that the music is <i>not in my
violin</i>, but <i>in me</i>.” Then drawing his bow, he sent forth
sounds sweet as ever entranced delighted mortals. Be assured,
the world is a coarse instrument at best, and if you
would send forth sweet sounds from its strings, there must
be music in your fingers. Fortune may favor, but do not
rely upon her—do not fear her. Act upon the doctrine of
the Grecian poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I seek what’s to be sought—</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I learn what’s to be taught—</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I beg the rest of heav’n.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>Talk not of genius. I grant there are differences in mind,
originally, but there is mind enough in every ordinary human
skull, if its energies are properly directed, to accomplish
mighty results. Fear not obstacles. What are your
difficulties? Poverty? ignorance? obscurity? Have they
not all been overcome by a host well known to fame? But
perchance you climb untrodden heights. Nevertheless, fear
to set down any obstacle as insuperable. Look at the
achievements of man in the natural and moral worlds, and
then say whether you dare set down any difficulty as insurmountable,
or whether you are ready to prescribe boundaries
to the operations of human power.</p>

<p>Are you destined to maintain the worship of the true God
amid the darkness of infidelity? Daniel in the den of lions,
Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego, in the flames of the furnace,
and a long line of illustrious martyrs, shouting hosannas
from the flames, put forth their hands from the
stake to beckon you onward. Are you destined to plant
the Gospel in heathen lands—an enterprise the most daring
and glorious in which mortals can engage? Do you imagine
you can meet a difficulty which the apostle Paul did not
vanquish? But he was an apostle, yea, and the most successful
of all the apostles. And what was the secret of his
success? Was it his learning? The gift of tongues made
the other apostles his equals in this respect. Was it his
eloquence? Doubtless he was eloquent; but Apollos, too,
was eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures. Was it his inspiration?
But were not others inspired, also? It was his
firmness and perseverance. When he preached Christ
Jesus and him crucified, nothing could drive or divert, or
daunt him: “This one thing I do,” etc.</p>

<p>Are you called to meet bigotry and superstition, armed
with learning, power, and wealth? See Luther braving
the thunders of the Vatican, and hear him say, “I would go
to Worms were there as many devils there as there are tiles
on the houses,” and then affirm, if you dare, that it is your
duty to succumb to your difficulties. Are you destined,
which heaven forbid, to lead an army to resist invaders, or
advance to conquest? Ask Cæsar, Hannibal, Pyrrhus,
Alexander, what kind of difficulties may be overcome by
decision of character. Have you undertaken to ascend from
poverty and obscurity to eminence and wealth? Ask the
field or the cabinet, any profession whatever, or either
house of Congress, whether there are any difficulties which
will not yield to firmness and perseverance, and ten thousand
voices shall respond, in animating accents, No.</p>

<h4><a id="GOD_MAGNIFIED_IN_HIS_WORKS"></a>GOD MAGNIFIED IN HIS WORKS.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></h4>

<p class="center">By G. CHAPLIN CHILD, M. D.</p>

<p>In an outlying province of the Turkish empire, where
sultan and firman are often superseded by the lawless will
of sheik or pacha, two famous rivers—Tigris and Euphrates—gradually
converge, and, after mingling their waters together,
glide gently onward to the Persian Gulf. In the
fork thus formed between them stretches a vast plain, made
known to us in early Scripture history as Shinar, Chaldæa,
and Babylon, as well as by other less familiar names, but
to which the term Mesopotamia has been more usually applied,
as it aptly designates a district “lying between rivers.”
The general aspect of this plain is one of desolation.
Fertile strips here and there border the Euphrates’ banks,
and willows are still seen flourishing where the sorrowing
Israelites once hung up their harps; but away from those
green fringes the eye wanders over wild, dreary wastes from
which the last traces of cultivation are slowly dying out. Vast
tracts lie soaked in permanent swamps, while much of the
remaining land is, at one period of the year, flooded by the
unheeded inundations of the neighboring rivers, and, at
another, baked into an arid desert by the burning rays of
the sun. It need scarcely be said that population has almost
disappeared from those melancholy plains; for the wandering
Arab is little tempted to pitch his tent or to pasture his
flocks on so sterile a soil. The doom that was so clearly
foretold by the prophets has fallen upon it, and Babylon
now “lies desolate in the sight of all that pass by.” It has
become the “habitation of the beasts of the desert.” As the
traveler plods onward over its unfrequented tracts, the startled
wild-fowl rises with quick splash from the reedy pool,
or a few scared gazelles may perhaps be descried bounding
over the distant plain. The “owl” and the “bittern,” the
jackal and the hyena add their testimony to the exactness
with which the words of Scripture have been fulfilled.
More rarely a solitary lion may be seen skulking among the
strange, mysterious mounds and “heaps” of stones that
loom here and there above the plain.</p>

<p>Mournful and dreary though this land now be, it is and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
ever will remain one of the most interesting spots on earth.
It was not always “desolate.” No other place, perhaps,
claims with a better title to be regarded as the scene where
our first parents walked together in paradise. Such, at
least, has been the common tradition; and in a well-known
edition of the Bible, published in 1599, may be found a map
of the Garden of Eden, of which the site of Babylon forms
the center. But, be that as it may, there can be no doubt of
its former greatness and fertility, for the record is plainly
written all over the soil. Everywhere it is furrowed by
ruined canals, of which some tell us of departed commerce
and wealth, others of skillful irrigation and abundant crops.
Heaps of rubbish are to be met with in which lie hidden
fragments of pottery which bear witness to the former presence
of a highly cultivated people; and uncouth mounds
rise strangely above the plain, in which the last relics of
palaces and cities are buried together. For centuries history
appeared to have lost her hold upon the great places of
the past, and it is only within the last few years that some
of them have been rescued from the oblivion that was
slowly creeping over them. Questioned by the light of
modern knowledge those mysterious stones of the plains
open up to us the first page in the history of nations—transport
us back almost to the dawn where antiquity begins,
and bring within our sight those to whom the deluge was
a recent event. They impart a substance to scenes we have
often tried in vain to realize. In imagination we see Nimrod
the Mighty Hunter, busy with the foundations of the
city of Babel on the neighboring Euphrates’ banks, and
piling up the “tower that was to reach Heaven.” Then it
was that the patriarchal dignity of early Bible records expanded
into royalty, and Babylon became the starting point
in the long pedigree of kingdoms.</p>

<p>Babylon touched the zenith of its grandeur two thousand
four hundred and fifty years ago, when Nebuchadnezzar sat
upon the throne. He was the great warrior of that age.
After overrunning Egypt he had returned to his capital
laden with its spoil; he had chastised his rebellious subjects
and treacherous allies, and he had utterly crushed the
power of the Kings of Judah. The wicked and faithless
Jehoiakim, blind to the warnings he received, had brought
a terrible doom upon his country; for Nebuchadnezzar, not
content with plundering the treasuries of the temple at Jerusalem,
carried the king himself a prisoner to Babylon.
Among the captives on this occasion were included Daniel
the Prophet and his three friends,—Ananias, Azarias, and
Misael, who in the land of their exile received the Chaldæan
names of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar was no less great in the arts of peace
than in those of war. He, therefore, encouraged learned
men to make his capital their resort, and he also promoted
the national prosperity by favoring agriculture and commerce.
He dug canals in all directions to fertilize the land
by irrigation. His merchants traded along the rich shores
of the Mediterranean, and penetrated even to remote China.
He provided for the security of Babylon by building or
strengthening its walls, and he made it beautiful by adorning
it with palaces. Its “hanging-gardens” were acknowledged
throughout ancient times to be one of the wonders of
the world, and their fame has endured up to this very hour.</p>

<p>At the court of such a monarch, Daniel’s learning was
sure to procure for him distinction, and he soon became a
member of the college of Magi or wise men. His subsequent
success in interpreting Nebuchadnezzar’s dream,
after all others had failed, raised him to the first rank in the
tyrant’s favor, and we are told that “he sat in the gate of
the king.” Nor in his prosperity did he forget his three
Jewish friends,—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,—who
through his influence were promoted to be governors in the
province of Babylon.</p>

<p>The history of Nebuchadnezzar and the burning, fiery
furnace—so illustrative on the one hand of perfect trust in
God, and, on the other, of God’s power to deliver his servants
from the assaults of their enemies—is endeared to all
as one of the interesting Scripture narratives by which
those who watched over us in the days of childhood endeavored
to attract us onward to the knowledge of our Bible. In
the book of Daniel it is related how Nebuchadnezzar, after
having been brought by the miraculous interpretation of
his dream to acknowledge the “God of Gods and Lord of
Kings,” subsequently relapsed into idolatry through the
corrupting influence of worldly prosperity. In the full
swell of his pride he set up a golden image, and commanded
that all his subjects should fall down and worship it. The
Babylonian nobles were jealous of the favor shown to the
three captives; and they, therefore, encouraged this wicked
fancy of the king, because it seemed to open out the means
of effecting their ruin. They rightly calculated that the Hebrew
Governors would never forsake the God of their Fathers,
nor worship the image which the king had set up. And
we know that when the hour of trial did come, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego remained true to their faith; and
were forthwith bound and cast into the burning, fiery furnace,
as a punishment for their disobedience to the tyrant’s
will.</p>

<p>From the torments and dangers of this ordeal the three
Hebrews were miraculously preserved. Daniel tells us that
Nebuchadnezzar himself saw them “loose and walking in
the midst of the fire.” “Not a hair of their heads was
singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell
of fire passed on them.” Elsewhere, in the Song of the
Three Children, we are told that “they walked in the midst
of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.” After so
signal a deliverance, it is easy to conceive the fervor with
which their hymn of gratitude was poured forth. The
deepest consciousness of the merciful power of God welled
up in their hearts and burst from their lips, and the whole
universe was ransacked for illustrations to typify and express
it. In whatever direction they turned, they beheld
Nature crowded with emblems of his greatness and mercy,
and they eagerly seized upon them as aids to bring their
thoughts up to the fervor of their adoration. Shall not we
also do wisely to profit by their example? Our daily obligations
to God may not be so miraculous, in the ordinary
meaning of the term, but they are, nevertheless, great and
countless beyond our power to conceive. Let us then, in
humble consciousness of the poverty and imperfection of
our thanksgivings, gladly make this suggestive hymn our
own; and let us on this, as on all occasions, accept with joy
every aid that helps us to “bless, praise, and magnify the
Lord.”</p>

<h2><a name="POISON_IN_COMMON_THINGS" id="POISON_IN_COMMON_THINGS">POISON IN COMMON THINGS.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By <span class="smcap">Prof. P. A. SIMPSON</span>, M. A., M. D.</p>


<h3>POISON IN THE AIR WE BREATHE.</h3>

<p>There are few words in the English language which produce
a more painful impression upon the popular mind
than does the word Poison, and there are at least two valid
reasons why it should be so. In the first place we find
poison waging war against human life, sometimes openly,
sometimes insidiously, often successfully; and in the second
place, from remote ages down to the present day, we are
accustomed to see poison going hand in hand with crime as
its chief companion. But we must remember that poison is
by no means an evil-doer, only as the agent of the assassin
or of the suicide. These are doubtless its most hideous aspects,
but there are many others where its effects are produced
as surely, though often very insidiously, without any
evil intention, and, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, clad in
garments which are intended for our good. It is to such
cases that we wish to direct attention, by pointing out a
few of the modes in our every-day life in which poison may
enter the human body without our knowledge, and wherein
its presence is unnoticed until disease or death makes it
manifest.</p>

<p>Let us, then, consider in the first place the composition
of atmospheric air, and how it may become so vitiated that,
instead of supporting life and health, it may carry disease
or death to those who breathe it. It was long thought that
air was spiritual, that it was like the life, and that it was
the soul of the world; but we now know that it is just as
material as a piece of iron, and that it will weigh down the
scales of a balance in the same way; and the time may yet
come when by means of immense pressure and intense cold
it may be condensed into a liquid, as carbonic acid and
other gases have already been. We find air present everywhere.
There is scarcely a solid, however compact it may
appear, which does not contain pores, and these pores are
filled with air. It is to be found in abundance in the soil;
indeed were it not so, numberless worms and insects which
inhabit the latter would cease to exist. The most compact
mortar and walls are penetrated by it, and water in its
natural state contains a large quantity of air in solution.
The atmosphere was formerly believed to extend no higher
than five miles above the earth’s surface, but meteorological
observations have since shown that it extends to a
height of more than two hundred miles. Owing to the
force of gravity the air is much denser near the earth, and
gets thinner, layer by layer, as you ascend. If then the atmosphere
were possessed of color it would be very dark
just round the globe, and the tint would gradually fade
into space. There is no absolutely normal condition of the
air we breathe; or, if there be, it is not at present known.
It contains, however, in all cases, unless under purely artificial
conditions, two <i>essential</i> elements, which are nearly
invariable under normal circumstances, namely, oxygen
and nitrogen, and two accessory elements which vary extremely
in amount, but are practically never absent,
namely, carbonic acid and water. Without either of the
first two, air could not exist, and without the last two, air
is scarcely found in nature. Their combination moreover
is not a chemical union but a simple mechanical mixture.
But besides these constituents the air contains an immense
amount of life, and small particles derived from the whole
creation. In the air may be found animalcules, spores,
seeds, cells of all kinds, eggs of insects, fungi and elements
of contagion, besides formless dust, and sandy and other
particles of local origin. For example, no one can travel in
a railway carriage without being surrounded by dust, a
large portion of which may be attracted by a magnet, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as it does in a great measure of minute particles of
iron derived from the rails. The purest air has some dust
in it. There probably never fell a beam of light from the
sun since the world was made which would not have shown
countless numbers of solid particles. Roughly speaking,
100 measures of air, if pure, should contain 78.98 parts of
nitrogen, 20.99 of oxygen, and .03 of carbonic acid. Without
oxygen a candle will not burn, and animals can not
live; but for the purposes of animal life this gas requires to
be diluted, and this is effected in the atmosphere by a large
admixture of nitrogen. In fact, nitrogen seems to act in
the animal economy purely as a diluent or vehicle for the
administration of oxygen. Carbonic acid, as far as we
know, is not essential to the animal kingdom. To man it
is simply a superfluous ingredient, but harmless when in
small quantity; to the vegetable world, on the contrary, it
is a food which together with water often suffices to support
the entire life of a plant. When, however, from any
cause the quantity of carbonic acid is much increased, it
becomes highly poisonous to man. When the amount
reaches 10 or even 5 volumes per cent. it produces fatal results,
and even 2 per cent. occasions in most persons severe
headache. The balance between carbonic acid and oxygen
in the atmosphere, continually disturbed in one direction
by the animal kingdom, is constantly maintained by the
vegetable kingdom; for while the former consumes oxygen
and gives off carbonic acid, the latter for the most part performs
the opposite function. Owing to certain local conditions,
however, which we shall presently consider, the
quantity of oxygen in the atmosphere sometimes falls below
the normal amount to the extent of over 3 per cent.,
while the carbonic acid proportionately increases. In
order to estimate the importance of what might otherwise
appear trifling differences in the composition of the air we
breathe, we must remember that we take into our lungs
from 1,000 to 2,000 gallons of air daily. Now the presence
of only a few grains of impurity in a gallon of water would
render it unfit for drinking purposes, although as we only
drink a comparatively small quantity of water the whole
of these few grains would not be swallowed in a single day.</p>

<p>We have spoken of carbonic acid as an impurity in the
atmosphere; and so it is, for it is unfitted to support animal
life. An animal will die from suffocation in an atmosphere
containing plenty of free oxygen if it contains over
10 or 12 per cent. of carbonic acid gas. But a minute
increase of this gas in the atmosphere is of most importance
from the fact that it always comes in bad company,
and is found to be a measure of the many impurities which
accompany it. Moreover, for every increase of carbonic
acid there is a corresponding decrease in oxygen, so that
we have in such cases a double effect, viz., a subtraction of
the life-giving principle of the air, and the addition of noxious
substitutes. These noxious substitutes consist for the
most part of organic matter, either of animal or vegetable
origin. The exact nature of the organic substances, which
constitute the specific poisons of contagious diseases, still
remains obscure. Whether they consist of inconceivably
minute particles of decaying matter, or of living microscopic
germs; whether in some instances they are conveyed
by particles of skin and pus-cells from the diseased
to the healthy, or are condensed with the watery vapor of
the atmosphere and thus disseminated; all these are questions
which have yet to be satisfactorily answered. It is,
however, certain that almost invariably the atmosphere is
made the vehicle of the contagion or deadly agent, whatever
may be its nature; and hence the great importance of
taking such precautions as will prevent the contamination
of the air; or at all events, aid in dissipating or destroying
its more hurtful impurities. An estimate of the amount of
organic impurity in the air of our large cities may be
formed by considering the enormous quantities of carbonic
acid gas that are daily and hourly poured forth in these industrial
centers. Dr. Angus Smith, whose investigations
regarding “Air and Rain” have won for him a world-wide
celebrity, has found that in the city of Manchester 15,066
tons of carbonic acid are daily passed into the air that envelops
it; and Dr. de Chanmont states that 822,000,000 cubic
feet of this gas are generated in London per day, or more
than 9,500 cubic feet per second. Fortunately the operations
of nature are in themselves calculated to restore a
state of equilibrium in the constitution of the air. Injurious
gases become diffused, diluted, or decomposed; animal
emanations are absorbed in the processes of vegetation;
suspended matters are washed down by rain, or fall by
their own weight, while many organic substances are so
acted on by oxygen as to render them innocuous. Thus
the vast aerial sea maintains a uniformity of composition,
owing to the mighty forces of nature, without which all
our sanitary measures would be futile. But if nature be so
powerful as a sanitary agent, how is it that we still require
to cope with that formidable enemy which we call foul air?
It is because we ourselves are constantly vitiating the atmosphere
around us whether we live, or work, or die, and
because the impure products thus generated are not sufficiently
provided against by efficient ventilation. Let us
glance briefly at the principal sources from which these impurities
rise. These may be grouped under three heads,
viz.: (1) Respiration; (2) Putrefaction; (3) Trades and
Manufactures.</p>

<p><i>Respiration.</i>—The air which we draw into our lungs
with every breath contains twenty-one per cent. of oxygen,
but when we expire it again it only contains 13 parts. We
have, in fact, abstracted 8 per cent. of oxygen and given
back in its place a poisonous mixture of carbonic acid, organic
matter, and watery vapor. We breathe out this
poisonous mixture at the rate of one gallon each minute,
but (even apart from the organic matter) it is so impure,
owing to the amount of carbonic acid which it contains,
that each gallon would require to be diluted with one
hundred gallons of pure air before being again fitted for respiration.
In such a city as London then, the air is being
polluted even by the carbonic acid which we exhale at the
rate of nearly six hundred million of gallons per minute, to
such an extent as to render it unfit to be breathed again.
Surely this should make us welcome every strong gale as
an angel sent from heaven bearing healing on its wings.
But it is in dwellings, and especially in the dwellings of
the poor, that the polluting effects of respiration are greatest,
for in these it is too often the case that man places
every possible obstacle in the way of nature’s methods of
ventilation. Moreover, in apartments that are crowded it
is practically impossible to maintain the air in a state of
purity, and thus they become hot-beds of disease. The very
interesting experiments made by Dr. Angus Smith upon
himself in an air-tight leaden chamber, led him to the conclusion
that, in air containing an increased amount of
carbonic acid, this gas alone, even without the other hurtful
ingredients, such as organic matter, rapidly produces
poisonous effects—indicated by feebleness of the circulation,
extreme slowness of the heart’s action, and great rapidity
of the breathing—and that when men are exposed
to it they are really gasping for breath, without being
aware of the cause.</p>

<p>The presence of carbonic acid in the air we expire is readily
seen by blowing our breath, by means of a tube, into a
bottle containing ordinary lime-water. The water soon becomes
opalescent and then milky in appearance, owing to
the formation of carbonate of lime or chalk; the carbonic
acid of the expired air having combined with the lime previously
held in solution. It is this principle which is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
advantage of in order to estimate the amount of carbonic
acid in atmospheric air. Dr. Angus Smith lays down a
simple practical rule whereby any one may ascertain if the
air of an apartment contains carbonic acid to a dangerous
amount, viz.: “Let us keep our rooms so that the air gives
no precipitate when a 10½-ounce bottle full of air is shaken
with half an ounce of clear lime water.”</p>

<p>It is well known that speedily fatal results arise from
overcrowding and want of fresh air. Out of the one hundred
and forty-six prisoners confined in the “Black Hole of
Calcutta,” one hundred and twenty three died in one night;
and it is significant that many of the survivors afterward
succumbed to “putrid fever.” Nor have similar instances
been wanting in this country. Of the one hundred and
fifty passengers that were shut up in the cabin of the Irish
steamer <i>Londonderry</i>, with hatches battened down during
a stormy night in 1848, seventy died before morning. In
these two catastrophes suffocation was doubtless the direct
cause of death, but the fact that “putrid fever” attacked
many of those who were carried out alive from the “Black
Hole of Calcutta,” showed that the fœtid exhalations to
which they were exposed must have aided largely in destroying
the lives of the immediate victims. The re-breathing
of fœtid matter thrown off by the skin and lungs produces
a kind of putrescence in the blood, in proportion to
the amount inhaled, and to the period of exposure to its influences;
and even air only moderately vitiated, if breathed
for a long time day after day, produces most serious results.
These results are seen in pale faces, loss of appetite, a lowering
of the spirits, and a decrease of muscular strength.
That air polluted by respiration is the one great cause of
consumption, which may be handed down from parents to
children for generations, rests upon such a mass of facts,
that it is no longer controvertible. For instance, we know
that increase of the disease occurs <i>pari passu</i> with an increase
in the density of population; that in manufacturing
centres, where the males are the chief workers at indoor
employment, the male death-rate is the highest; that in
others, where females are principally required at indoor
work, they suffer most; and that in agricultural districts,
where the men spend nearly all their lives in the open air,
and the women scarcely ever leave their cottages, the female
death-rate from this disease is higher than the male. Moreover,
the testimony of the most able physicians at home
and abroad, the results of inquiries as to the prevalence of
this disease amongst the picked men of the armies and
navies of the world, the reports of hospitals for consumption,
and of commissioners and committees appointed to make
special investigations of jails, workhouses, and schools—all
these point to poisoning by impure air as the most fertile
source of consumption and many allied diseases.</p>

<p><i>Putrefaction.</i>—We now pass on to the second source of
foulness of the air, viz.: putrefaction. Putrid emanations
have from the earliest times been held to be capable of producing
injurious effects on the human system. In the Bible
we read of the great care taken to disinfect or clean vessels
which may have contained any putrid matter, and in
ancient Rome measures were adopted for the efficient cleansing
of the sewers and streets of that city. Our present
method of disposing of our refuse is by means of water,
which washes it through channels called “sewers” to the
sea. But meanwhile the organic portions are undergoing
decay, and certain gases are thus evolved, which, mixing
together, form what we term “sewer gas.” The principal
gases thus given off are carbonic acid, nitrogen, and sulphuretted
hydrogen, and although this mixture if breathed
is injurious to health, it can not be regarded as poisonous.
Thus sulphuretted hydrogen (similar to the odor given off
by rotten eggs) although a deadly poison when inhaled in
large quantities, is so diluted in sewer gas that its poisonous
properties are in a great measure neutralized. There is still,
however, sufficient sulphuretted hydrogen in sewer gas to
render it very injurious by lowering the tone of health, and
by gradually diminishing vitality to such an extent that
disease ensues. What, however, is of far greater importance
as a poisonous agent, is the organic matter which is held in
suspension by these gases. The composition of this organic
matter is by no means uniform. It is composed of particles
from all kinds of decomposing matter, sometimes containing
minute living organisms, and sometimes without doubt
the germs of disease. The exact nature of these germs of
disease is still a matter of uncertainty, and the question as
to whether they may appear spontaneously during the progress
of decay, or whether they are merely wafted by sewer
gas, just as the ripe seeds of many plants are scattered by the
atmosphere, is equally unsettled. This, however, has been
sufficiently established, that when diseases do come amongst
us they take root with most effect in those places where decomposing
matter is found, and that the germs of these diseases
find in the organic element of sewer gas a congenial
soil, in which they can increase and multiply indefinitely,
and by which they can be carried from the dead to the living.
That typhoid fever depends, to a great extent, upon the
polluted air of sewers, cesspools, and of the soil, is proved by
very strong evidence. In some cases the disease has been
confined to a particular part of the house, especially exposed
to the effluvia from badly trapped drains, where there could
be no doubt as to the source of the infection. The sewer air,
laden with the specific poison, may be inappreciable to the
senses, but its hurtful effects make themselves felt none the
less, and, as recent events have shown, may sometimes exhibit
themselves in the most exalted stations of life. Nay,
more, it would seem that persons of the upper and middle
ranks in towns are more liable to be attacked by typhoid
fever than the poor classes; the reason being that the houses
of the former are more generally connected with sewers, and
either from structure or situation are of higher elevation, so
that the light sewer gases, obeying natural laws, are more apt
to accumulate in the drains of such houses, and failing efficient
trapping and ventilation of the drains, to effect an
entrance into the houses themselves. There is good ground
for the belief that cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, as well
as many other diseases, are occasionally spread by means of
the air of sewers and cesspools; but whether these diseases
originate spontaneously in this way, or whether the sewer
gas only serves as a carrier of the disease-germs, is a question,
as in the case of typhoid fever, as yet unsettled.</p>

<p><i>Trades and Manufactures.</i>—Let us next consider some
trades and manufactures which have an injurious influence
upon persons engaged in them, and to a certain extent upon
the community at large. The injurious effects are owing to
solid particles and offensive gases which are given out into
the air. The result of inhaling air more or less charged with
solid particles may be easily explained. When the latter
reach the entrance to the windpipe they at once set up irritation
in the delicate lining membrane, and nature tries to
repel the intruders by the involuntary cough which results.
Should this fit of coughing fail in doing so, a quantity of
glairy fluid is poured out from small glands in the windpipe,
and this fluid enveloping the solid particles tends to prevent
them from doing further mischief. Should they, however
find their way lower down into the air passages, nature
has provided a very beautiful mechanism for their expulsion.
The entire lining membrane of these passages is covered
with innumerable minute hairs, or “cilia” as they are
called, which, by constantly waving in an upward direction
toward the mouth, tend to carry the solid particles, and the
glairy secretion which they have provoked, away from the
lungs, and so out of harm’s way. This wonderful provision
of nature is sufficient for the purpose, provided the strain be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
not too prolonged; but when the supply of irritating particles
is constant, or nearly so, the nerves and muscles involved
in this mechanism become exhausted and cease to
perform this process of expulsion. The irritating particles
are now no longer removed from the delicate membrane of
the air passages upon which they lodge, this membrane becomes
inflamed, and bronchitis or asthma is the result. But
this inflammation, at first only affecting the superficial
membrane, may sink into the deeper tissues and affect the
lung itself, in which case the original attack of bronchitis
frequently merges into a condition of a consumptive nature.
This will explain why many trades are injurious in which
the danger to health is due to the fine dust floating continually
in the air of the premises. For example, the particles
of coal dust in the air of mines, and the smoke from factory
chimneys; particles of steel and grit given off in grinding;
organic dust or fluff in shoddy and flax mills; the dust in
potteries, china works, pearl button manufactories, in polishing
and cement works, in brass works, in marble and
steel polishing works of various sorts, especially where emery
is used; in all of these cases the solid particles are inhaled
and tend to produce disease in the lungs and air passages.
Moreover, the severity of the effects is chiefly dependent
on the amount of dust, and on the physical conditions
as to angularity, roughness or smoothness of the
particles, rather than on the nature of the substance, except
in some specific cases. The habitual inhalation of coal dust
in the air of coal mines very frequently results in consumption,
and the fine divisions of the lung become so blocked
up by the particles of coal that the term “black lung” has
been applied to the appearance presented by the lung after
death. It has been found that the death rate from consumption
among miners who work in mines where the air
is changed rapidly, is very much less than among miners
who work in mines that are badly ventilated. Of all unhealthy
occupations that of steel-grinding is the most fatal.
Steel-grinding is divided into the dry, wet, and mixed methods;
and the injurious effects vary according to the amount
of water used on the stone. Forks, needles, etc., are ground
on the dry stone, and accordingly the men and boys employed
at this kind of work are found to be the greatest sufferers.
Dr. Hall, of Sheffield, has furnished important information
as to the average duration of life among the artisans
in steel, which he found to be as follows, viz.: dry
grinders of forks, 29 years; razors, 31 years; scissors, 32
years; edge-tool and wool-shears, 32 years; spring-knives,
35 years; files, 35 years; saws, 38 years; sickles, 38 years.
In this and many other similarly injurious trades various
methods have from time to time been devised,
more especially of late years, whereby the dust might be
prevented from entering the air-passages, such as fans
for blowing it away, and respirators of various kinds to
filter the air as it is being breathed; but it has been found
that workmen themselves frequently object to any innovation
which appears to them to interfere with their more
immediate comfort. There are some trades where the dust
given off acts not only as a mechanical irritant when
breathed, but where the substance thus inhaled acts as a
direct poison. For instance, manufacturers of white lead
and other mineral paints frequently exhibit symptoms of
poisoning in this way, and workmen who use arsenical compounds,
as in the making of wall papers, artificial flowers,
etc., are often the victims of poisoning by arsenic. This
poisoning by means of arsenical wall papers deserves more
than a passing notice, owing to the dangerous and even fatal
effects which they induce, not only in the workmen who
prepare them, but also in persons inhabiting apartments
where the walls are covered by them. These wall papers
are mostly of a beautiful green color, the latter being due to
a paint composed of arsenic and copper. Owing to variations
of heat and moisture the green particles are constantly
being set free from the paper and carried about the
room by ventilation. Some idea of the amount of poison
with which so many people are surrounded in their rooms
may be formed if we consider that this green pigment contains
fifty-nine per cent of arsenic, and that a square foot of
one of these wall papers contains on an average more than
sufficient arsenic to poison twelve persons. In addition to
the cases which most physicians are now so familiar with,
where dangerous symptoms of poisoning have been traced
to this cause, it is much to be feared that insidious and
chronic disease is too often due to this practice of covering
the walls of our sitting-rooms, and more especially our bedrooms,
with arsenic. It may be remembered, however, that
a wall paper may be green and yet not contain any arsenic,
so that the following simple method of detecting an arsenical
paper may be useful. If a camel-hair brush be dipped
in an ordinary solution of ammonia, and applied to the
green portions of the suspected paper, the green will be rapidly
changed to an azure blue color if arsenic be present.
Some such simple test is all the more important, because
green papers, “warranted free from arsenic,” have been
found to contain a large percentage of that poison.</p>

<p>In addition to the sources of pollution of the atmosphere
which we have been considering, there are various trades
and manufactures in which poisonous matters are given off.
Some of these are of an organic nature, as in the melting of
fats, in the making of size and glue, in the boiling of oil,
in the boiling of bones, and in many other processes carried
out on a considerable scale, where the emanations are highly
offensive and often of unknown chemical composition. Gas
works must be included in this poisonous group, owing to
the accidental escape of gas, sometimes in large quantity.
In lime kilns enormous volumes of carbonic acid gas are
poured out, both from the limestone burnt and from the
fuel employed, and in this way persons living in the immediate
neighborhood have been suffocated. In chloride of
lime (bleaching powder) manufactories, and in places where
it is used for bleaching wool and other materials, chlorine
gas is given off into the air, causing when inhaled a great
amount of irritation in the air passages. Moreover, this
chlorine vapor is often carried in the air for long distances.
In other branches of industry the workers are exposed to the
vapors of sulphurous acid and muriatic acid, both of these
being very irritating, and giving rise to various diseases of
the lungs and eyes.</p>

<p>Such, then, are a few of the impurities, more or less
poisonous, to be met with in the air we breathe; and dangerous
to health as all of them are, it must be admitted that
they do far less mischief to the public health than the continual
mismanagement of our atmospheric food, common in
all classes of society, by which it is rendered unfit to support
a healthy life. The two ways in which air may be rendered
thus comparatively valueless are either by excluding
it too much from our dwellings, and this is the fault of the
rich, or by crowding too many people together in small
rooms, and this is the fault of the poor. In the houses of
the better classes the air is kept out by closed windows,
doors, curtains, and even in some places by putting screens
before the fire-places in summer, and in bedrooms in winter
when fire is not used.</p>

<p>Pure air is, in fact, the most important of all health factors.
When it is breathed freely, plentifully, and continually,
there are few diseases which it will not enable the body
to resist. Nay, even some injuries, which, received by the
denizens of the overcrowded city, would be speedily followed
by death, will be readily recovered from by the agricultural
laborer or country farmer, who, always breathing a pure
atmosphere, has thus stored up a great amount of additional
constitutional force.—<i>Good Words.</i></p>

<h3>UNPREPOSSESSING MANNERS.</h3>

<p>This epigram in Martial,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse" lang="la">Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare;</div>
<div class="verse" lang="la"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te;</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>has puzzled a great many people, who can not conceive
how it is possible to love any body, and yet not know the
reason why. I think I conceive Martial’s meaning very
clearly, though the nature of the epigram, which is to be
short, would not allow him to explain it more fully; and I
take it to be this: O Sabidis, you are a very worthy, deserving
man; you have a thousand good qualities, you have
a great deal of learning; I esteem, I respect, but for the
soul of me I can not love you, though I can not particularly
say why. You are not <i>amiable;</i> you have not those engaging
manners, those pleasing attentions, those graces,
and that address, which are absolutely necessary to please,
though impossible to define. I can not say it is this
or that particular thing that hinders me from loving
you; it is the whole together; and upon the whole you are
not agreeable.</p>

<p>How often have I, in the course of my life, found myself
in this situation, with regard to many of my acquaintance,
whom I have honored and respected, without being able to
love. I did not know why, because, when one is young,
one does not take the trouble, nor allow one’s self the time,
to analyze one’s sentiments, and to trace them up to their
source. But subsequent observation and reflections have
taught me why. There is a man, whose moral character,
deep learning, and superior parts, I acknowledge, admire,
and respect; but whom it is so impossible for me to love,
that I am almost in a fever whenever I am in his company.
His figure (without being deformed) seems made to disgrace
or ridicule the common structure of the human body.
His legs and arms are never in the position which, according
to the situation of the body, they ought to be in, but
constantly employed in committing acts of hostility upon
the graces. He throws any where, but down his throat,
whatever he means to drink, and only mangles what he
means to carve. Inattentive to all the regards of social
life, he mistimes or misplaces everything. He disputes
with heat, and indiscriminately, mindless of the rank,
character, and situation of those with whom he disputes;
absolutely ignorant of the several gradations of familiarity
or respect, he is exactly the same to his superiors, his
equals, and his inferiors; and therefore, by a necessary consequence,
absurd to two of the three. Is it possible to love
such a man? No. The utmost I can do for him is to consider
him as a respectable Hottentot.</p>


<h3>METHOD.</h3>

<p>Despatch is the soul of business; and nothing contributes
more to despatch than method. Lay down a method for
everything, and stick to it inviolably, as far as unexpected
incidents may allow. Fix one certain hour and day in the
week for your accounts, and keep them together in their
proper order; by which means they will require little time,
and you can never be much cheated. Whatever letters and
papers you keep, docket and tie them up in their respective
classes, so that you may instantly have recourse to any
one. Lay down a method also for your reading, for which
you allot a certain share of your mornings; let it be in a consistent
and consecutive course and not in that desultory and
immethodical manner, in which many people read scraps
of different authors upon different subjects. Keep a useful
and short common-place book of what you read, to help
your memory only, and not for pedantic quotations. One
method more I recommend to you, by which I have found
great benefit, even in the most dissipated part of my life;
that is, to rise early, and at the same hour every morning,
how late soever you may have sat up the night before.
This secures you an hour or two, at least, of reading or reflection,
before the common interruptions of the morning
begin; and it will save your constitution, by forcing you to
go to bed early, at least one night in three.</p>

<p>You will say, it may be, as many young people would, that
all this order and method is very troublesome, only fit for
dull people, and a disagreeable restraint upon the noble
spirit and fire of youth. I deny it; and assert, on the contrary,
that it will procure you both more time and more
taste for your pleasures; and so far from being troublesome
to you, that, after you have pursued it a month, it would
be troublesome to you to lay it aside. Business whets the
appetite, and gives a taste to pleasures, as exercise does to
food; and business can never be done without method; it
raises the spirits for pleasures; and an assembly will much
more sensibly affect a man who has employed, than a man
who has lost, the preceding part of the day; nay, I will venture
to say, that a fine lady will seem to have more charms
to a man of study or business, than to a saunterer. The
same listlessness runs through his whole conduct, and he is
as insipid in his pleasures as inefficient in everything else.</p>

<h2><a name="COMETS" id="COMETS">COMETS.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By RICHARD A. PROCTOR.</p>


<p>During the last two years several comets—some telescopic,
others visible to the naked eye, and even conspicuous
objects in the heavens—have been observed, not
only by the older methods, but by some which have only
been available within recent years. It is naturally expected,
therefore, by the general public that some new
light should be thrown on these mysterious objects, whose
phenomena still remain among the unexplained, seemingly
the inexplicable problems of the celestial depths.</p>

<p>We propose to consider here what has thus been learned,
and what also (unfortunately it is much more) remains
still to be learned, respecting comets. But first it will be
well to show what are the special phenomena which present
themselves for explanation.</p>

<p>A comet apparently comes out from the remote depths of
space in a condition of comparative calm. It appears as a
small round nebulous object, looking like a tiny cloud of
extreme tenuity—the idea of tenuity being suggested by the
exceeding faintness of the comet’s light. This cloud appears
somewhat condensed toward the middle. As the
comet draws nearer to the sun, it usually grows somewhat
long in the direction of the sun; and before long a portion
within the part nearest the sun is seen to be brighter than
the rest, and to have a more or less defined outline. This
is the <i>nucleus</i>—sometimes seen as a dull disc of nearly uniform
brightness, at others as a mere bright point not unlike
a star. The fainter light around this is the <i>coma</i>, or hair,
which resembles a luminous fog round the nucleus, usually
brighter on the side toward the sun, and on the other side
growing fainter and fainter till it can no longer be seen.
Later this lengthening of the comet in directions toward
and from the sun becomes more marked, until at length
the comet may fairly be said to have a head directed toward
the sun and a tail directed from him. Nucleus, coma, and
tail may be very different in appearance in different comets,
and in particular the tail may be more or less complicated
in structure, being sometimes a mere straight streak, at
others twofold, multiple, curved, with thwart streaks, and
so forth—no two comets, in fine, having tails resembling
each other except in general details.</p>

<p>Dr. Huggins, in a rather disappointing article on comets,
recently communicated to a contemporary, remarks that
the nucleus, though an apparently insignificant speck, “is
truly the heart and kernel of the whole thing—potentially
it is the comet.” This has scarcely yet been proved, though
it appears exceedingly probable. It is true, however, as he
adds, that this part only of the comet conforms rigorously
to the laws of gravitation, and moves strictly in its orbit. “If
we could see a great comet,” he proceeds, “during its distant
wandering, when it has put off the gala trappings of
perihelion excitement, it would appear as a very sober object,
and consist of little more than nucleus alone.” This
again seems probable, though it has never yet been proved,
and the division of some comets into two or more parts, each
having coma, nucleus, and tail of its own, shows that the
nucleus cannot be, in every case, what Dr. Huggins seems
here to suggest. Dr. Huggins has done well in saying
(though scarcely with sufficient emphasis, considering how
often the mistake is repeated) that “though many telescopic
comets are of extremely small mass, nucleus included—so
small, indeed, that they are unable to perturb such small
bodies as Jupiter’s satellites—yet we should mistake greatly
if we were to suppose that all comets are ‘airy nothings.’ In
some large comets the nucleus may be a few hundred miles
in diameter, or even very much larger, and may consist of
solid matter. It is not necessary to say that the collision of
a cometary nucleus of this order with the earth would produce
destruction on a wide scale.”</p>

<p>It is even more necessary to correct the widely-spread
misapprehension as to the relations between meteors and
comets. We hear it stated that the nucleus of a comet is
made up of meteoric stones (Professor P. G. Tait says—for
unknown reasons—that they resemble “paving stones or
even bricks”) as confidently as though the earth had at
some time passed through the nucleus of a comet, and some
of our streets were now paved with stones which had fallen
to earth on such an occasion. As a matter of fact, all that
has yet been proved is that meteoric bodies follow in the
track (which is very different from the tail) of some known
comets, and that probably all comets are followed by trains
of meteors. These may have come out of the head or nucleus
in some way as yet unexplained; but it is by no means
certain that they have done so, and it is by many astronomers
regarded as more than doubtful.</p>

<p>The most important points to be noticed in the behavior
of large comets, as they approach the sun, is that usually
the side of the coma which lies toward the sun is the scene
of intense disturbance. Streams of luminous matter seem
to rise continually toward the sun, attaining a certain distance
from the head, when, assuming a cloud-like appearance,
they seem to form an envelope around the nucleus.
This envelope gradually increases its distance from the sun,
growing fainter and larger, while within it the process is
repeated, and a new envelope is formed. This in turn ascends
from the nucleus, expanding as it does so, while within
it a new envelope is formed. Meanwhile, the one first
formed has grown fainter, perhaps has disappeared. But
sometimes the process goes on so rapidly (a day or two
sufficing for the formation of a complete new envelope) that
several envelopes will be seen at the same time, the outermost
faintest, the innermost most irregular in shape and
most varied in brightness, while the envelope or envelopes
between are the best developed and most regular.</p>

<p>The matter raised up in these envelopes seems to have
undergone a certain change of character, causing it no
longer to obey the sun’s attractive influence, but to experience
a strong repulsive action from him, whereby it is apparently
swept away with great rapidity to form the tail.
“It flows past the nucleus,” says Dr. Huggins, “on all
sides, still ever expanding and shooting backward until a
tail is formed in a direction opposite to the sun. This tail
is usually curved, though sometimes rays or extra tails sensibly
straight are also seen.” The description is, however,
incomplete in one important respect. The matter raised
from the nucleus to form the envelopes may be, and probably
is, carried past the nucleus on all sides; but the appearance
presented by the tail just behind the nucleus is not
exactly in accordance with our ideas as to what should result
from the flowing past “on all sides.” There is a dark
space immediately behind the nucleus, that is, where the
nucleus, if solid, would throw its shadow, if there were matter
to receive the light all around so that the shadow could
be seen. Now it may be thought at first that this corresponds
exactly with what should be seen: when we look
just behind the nucleus there is no light, or very little;
when we look on either side of that dark space there is the
luminous matter which has been driven back from the envelopes
in front of the nucleus. But if the luminous matter
flows past the nucleus <i>on all sides</i>, it must flow past the nucleus
on the side nearest to the observer, and also on the
side farthest away; and it is just where the line of the sight
passes through these two regions of brightness that a dark
streak is seen just behind the nucleus. Let the reader draw
two concentric circles—one an inch in diameter, the other
two inches—and let him then draw two parallel tangents to
the inner circle on opposite sides of it. Supposing now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
space between the two circles to represent in section the luminous
matter which flows all round the nucleus, while the
surface of the inner circle represents the unilluminated part
behind the nucleus, the two tangent lines will represent the
lines of sight on either side of the dark region, where as we
might expect, we get plenty of light; and we can also understand
very well why outside of that the line of sight
through the luminous matter (or the chords to our outer
circle), getting shorter and shorter, the light of the luminous
streaks bounding this part of the tail gets fainter and
fainter; but if just inside either of the two tangents, chords
are drawn parallel to them, crossing the inner circle, the
parts of these chords which lie between the two circles are
very nearly equal in length to the tangent lines themselves;
and even a common diameter to both circles has, lying between
them, two portions together equal to the radius of the
outer. Hence, since the line of sight even across the middle
of the space behind the nucleus, passes through a considerable
range of luminous matter, while a line within but
near the outskirts of that space passes through nearly as
great a range of luminous matter as one just outside that
space, there should be plenty of light where yet to the eye
there seems to be something like absolute darkness. Either
then the eye is greatly deceived, or else we must find some
explanation of darkness existing where considerable brightness
might be expected.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>The matter which forms the tail, seems, as I have said, to
be swept off from the envelopes raised by the sun’s action
on the nucleus. It seems as though the matter thus raised
had undergone in some way a change of character, which
caused it no longer to obey the law of gravity as it had done
when forming part of the nucleus, but instead of yielding to
the sun’s attraction, to submit rather to an intense repulsive
action, carrying it at a much greater rate from the sun
than, under the action of gravity—starting from rest and
free from all perturbing influences—it could have been
drawn toward him. Dr. Huggins thus words his account of
what seems to happen: “Now is seen to take place a change
which is most puzzling—namely, these envelopes of light
appear to give up their substance under the influence of a
strong repulsive force exerted from the sun, and to be
forced backwards.” Sir John Herschel, after his long and
careful study of the comet of 1830 (Halley’s at its second return)
came to the conclusion that repulsive action exerted
by the sun on the matter raised in these envelopes had been
distinctly proved.</p>

<p>Yet here, where we seem to have our first firm ground for
hypothesis respecting these mysterious objects—comets’
tails—we meet with stupendous difficulties. Consider, for
instance, the phenomena presented by Newton’s comet.
That comet had traversed the last ninety millions of miles
of its approach toward the sun in four weeks. At the end
of that time it passed out of view for a few days, having
then a tail ninety millions of miles, at least, in length.
Four days passed, and it reappeared on the other side of the
sun—having in the interval traversed nearly a semi-circle—in
reality, of course, the perihelion end of its long oval path.
At its reappearance, it had a tail still ninety millions of
miles in length, but the tail with which it reappeared had,
of course, a direction entirely different from that of the tail
which had been seen before—the two directions were inclined
about one hundred and sixty degrees to each other. Now, as
Sir John Herschel remarks, we can not look on the tail of a
comet as something whirled round like a stick, as the comet
circles round its perihelion sweep. The tail with which the
comet reappeared must have been an entirely new formation.
Nor can we doubt that if the comet had been watched as it
swept around the sun, the changes in the tail’s position
which had been observed to the time of disappearance,
would have been observed to progress continuously, the tail
passing by a uniform motion from the position it then had
to that which it was observed to have at the time of reappearance.
So that we may fairly suppose the tail with which
the comet reappeared to have been formed in much less than
the time during which the comet had been out of sight.
Probably its farthest part had been formed in much less
than a day, the part near the head being, of course, formed
later. But if the matter repelled from the head was thus
driven over a distance of ninety million miles in twenty-four
hours, at the outside, the average velocity of its motion
was about a thousand miles per second, or nearly three
times as great as the greatest velocity which the sun <i>can</i>
communicate by his attractive energy to matter approaching
him from without, even though such matter come to
him from an almost infinite distance, and in a perfectly
straight line—the conditions most favorable for giving a
high rate of final velocity. Such velocity as the sun can
thus give by his attractive energy is only given to matter
which has been exposed a long time to his influence; but
here, in the tail of the great comet of 1680, matter seems to
have acquired almost instantaneously a velocity sufficing to
carry it over ninety million miles with an average speed
three times as great as the sun can thus, after long effort,
communicate by means of his attractive power!</p>

<p>The difficulty is so great that many efforts—some bold and
daring, others positively wild in the unscientific absurdity
of their nature—have been made to overcome it.</p>

<p>Among the most ingenious of these is (or rather was, for
I think it is no longer maintained even by its eminent
author), Prof. Tyndall’s theory of a comet’s tail as an actinic
cloud, generated by the passage of the solar rays through
exceedingly tenuous matter after those rays had been in
part deprived of their heating power, during their passage
through the comet’s head. According to this theory the
actinic cloud can not be formed under the heating rays, but
so soon as the actinic rays fall on the tenuous matter alone,
the cloud is formed,—so that all round the region in which
would be the comet’s shadow, there is no luminous cloud,
while along that region the cloud exists. The rapidity with
which light travels would of course make this explanation
absolutely perfect in explaining cometic tails lying always
exactly in a straight line directed from the sun, or with
their axis so situated. But unfortunately this exceedingly
rapid formation of the tail (a tail of ninety million miles in
length would be formed in about eight minutes) is more
than observation requires or can explain. Prof. Tyndall
made a slight oversight in dealing with this part of his
theory. Noticing that the actinic cloud, as he called it, is
not formed instantly, but after a delay of a few seconds, in
his experiments, he reasoned as though it would follow from
this that the formation of the actinic cloud behind a comet’s
head in space might be a process extending its action in distance
from the head at a rate considerably less than that at
which light travels, yet still fast enough to account for the
exceedingly rapid formation of the tail of Newton’s comet,
and of other similar tails. But a little consideration will
show that the few seconds following the fall of light on the
vapors dealt with by Tyndall, before the luminous cloud appeared,
would produce no such effect as he imagined. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
rate of formation of the tail would still be that at which
light travels. Imagine the head at A, for the sake of argument,
and the sun’s light after reaching A, passing on to
B, C, D, E, etc., to Z, a distance say of one hundred million
miles, in nine minutes:</p>

<p class="center">
A&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;B&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;C&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;D&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;E&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Z.<br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>Suppose that, when the light has reached the vaporous matter
lying at B, an interval of one full minute (much greater
than any noticed in Tyndall’s experiments), occurs before
the actinic cloud comes into view, a similar interval after
the light has passed C before the cloud is seen there, and so
on, up to the time of the arrival of the light at Z. Professor
Tyndall’s reasoning implied that all the time intervals thus
occurring at B, C, D, E, etc., up to Z, had to be added together,
to give the total time of the formation of the tail from
A to Z, and hence naturally a long time might elapse, and
the head having at the end of this time reached a different
position from that which it had occupied at the beginning,
the divergence of the tail from the direction exactly opposite
to the sun, and the curvature of the tail, would be alike
readily accounted for. But what are the actual facts of the
case. The part of the tail formed latest by the supposed
solar actinic action, namely, the part at Z, would be formed
just nine minutes after the light had left A, and ten minutes
after the part nearest to A had been formed (by the
same light waves), for, nine minutes after leaving A, the
light would be at Z, and a minute after each epoch (according
to our supposition) the actinic cloud would be formed
respectively at A and at Z. We get just the same interval—nine
minutes—whether the actinic cloud appears immediately
after light has traversed the vapour which is to form
the cloud, or a minute after, or an hour after. In every case
the tail would be formed outwards from A, at the rate at
which light travels. This does not accord with the phenomena—in
fact, the supposition that a tail could be formed
at the rate at which light travels, will be found, on examination,
to lead to many most manifest absurdities, which Professor
Tyndall doubtless recognized when he sought escape
from the supposition of such rapid tail formation, through
the effects he attributed to the delayed appearance of the
actinic cloud.</p>

<p>Another theory in explanation of the rapid formation of
such a tail as that of Newton’s comet is worthy of far less
notice. Professor Tyndall’s theory was based on an interesting
physical fact, which he had himself discovered, and
which was also manifestly akin in character to the formation
of a comet’s tail. The one to be now noticed was suggested
to a mathematician by a rather familiar phenomenon,
the effects of which on his imagination he seems to have
been never able to entirely overcome—at any rate no
amount of evidence against the theory seems to counterbalance
in his mind the notion once conceived that the
theory might be true. (It is a way some theorists have.)</p>

<p>Professor Tait was once looking at a part of the sky which
seemed clear. As he looked, a long streak rapidly formed,
which presently disappeared (if I remember his original description
aright) almost as rapidly as it had formed. At
any rate, the appearance of the streak was rapid enough to
remind him of what astronomers said about the rapid (apparent)
development of comets’ tails. The phenomenon
itself was easily explained. There had been a flight of seabirds,
traveling after their wont in a widely extended layer,
which when he began his observations had been looked at
somewhat aslant, so that—the distance being too great for
the birds to be seen individually—nothing of the flight could
be discerned at all. But it is evident that in such a case a
very slight movement on the part of each bird would suffice
so to shift the position of the layer in which they were traveling,
that it would be seen edgewise, and then the birds,
being so situated that the range of sight toward any part of
the layer passed athwart a great number of them, would of
course be seen, not individually but as a cloud, or long
straight streak, a side view in fact of the layer in which
they were traveling. <i>Eureka!</i> shouted Professor Tait; and
presently announced to the world the marvelous theory that
the rapid formation of comets’ tails may be accounted for on
the same general principle. Astronomers have found that
along the tracks of some comets (where the tails never lie,
by the way, but that is a detail) are countless millions of
meteoric bodies separately undiscernable (and never yet
discerned as a cloud—another detail); therefore it follows
that the tails of all comets are formed by movements of
“brickbats and paving stones” in them (Professor Tait’s own
description of meteors), after the manner of the seabirds he
saw from Arthur’s Seat. Professor Thomson at the Edinburgh
meeting of the British Association endorsed this theory
with special reference to the value of the “seabird analogy”
in explaining the phenomena of Newton’s comet. Dr. Huggins,
who, as he does not claim to be a mathematician (or to
speak more correctly, as his labors in physical research have
not given him time for profound mathematical research),
may be more readily excused, also speaks of the seabird theory
as if it had some legitimate standing. “The tail, he conceives,”
he says, referring to Dr. Tait, “to be a portion of the
less dense part of the train illuminated by sunlight, and
visible or invisible to us, according, not only to circumstances
of density, illumination, and nearness, but also of
tactic arrangement, as of a flock of birds under different
conditions of perspective.” Of course, the theory is utterly
untenable—by astronomers who know something of the actual
facts, and have enough mathematics to consider simple
geometrical relations. Bodies moving in a plane surface
like birds, if they individually travel in the same plane,
keep its position unchanged. But if they move individually
at an angle to that plane (as they occasionally do), they
change its position—the surface, however, in which they
collectively are at any moment, still remaining plane. In
such a case only could such a phenomenon as was observed
by Professor Tait be seen. But in such a case the visibility
of the streak formed by the flight of birds would last but a
few minutes, for the same motion which had in a few minutes
brought the streak into view would in the next few
minutes take it out of view. During the short time that a
flight is visible in this way, it has an unchanging position,
or a scarcely changing one. If the tail of Newton’s comet
had rapidly formed and as rapidly vanished, remaining,
while visible, in an almost unchanging position, the “seabird
analogy” might explain that particular phenomenon,
however inadequate to explain multitudes of others. But
the phenomena to be explained are entirely different.
Leaving out of the question the varying position and length
of the tail as it approached the sun, and after it left the sun’s
neighborhood, all of which were entirely inconsistent with
the seabird analogy, what we are called upon to explain is
that a visible tail ninety millions of miles in length, seen in
position 1<small>A</small> on one day, was seen three days later in position
3<small>A</small> (having manifestly in the meanwhile passed through all
the intermediate positions, including 2<small>A</small>). If Professor Tait,
profound mathematician though he be, though he may
“differentiate and integrate like Harlequin,” can show how
any flight of bodies, like or unlike seabirds, can accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
such a feat as the above, appearing first to form a thin streak
<small>A</small>1, and in less than four days a thin streak <small>A</small>3, each ninety
millions of miles long, without <i>some</i> of them having had to
travel a distance nearly equal to the line 1 to 3—or some one
hundred and fifty millions of miles long, instead of the
trifling journeys he assigned them, he should take a rank
above Newton and Laplace as a mathematician. But there
is another feat, apparently equally difficult to him, which
he might achieve very readily with great advantage to those
non-mathematicians among astronomers whom his name—well
deserved, too—as a mathematician has hitherto misled,
and with not less advantage to his own reputation: he might
frankly admit that the idea which occurred to him while
watching those unfortunate seabirds, had not quite the value
which at the moment he mistakenly attached to it, and has
since <i>seemed</i> to do.</p>

</div>

<p>But apart from the consideration of theories such as those,
either demonstrably untenable, though ingenious, like Professor
Tyndall’s, or altogether and obviously untenable like
Professor Tait’s, there are certain phenomena of comets’
tails which force upon us the belief that they are phenomena
of repulsion, though the repulsive action is of a kind
not yet known to physicists.</p>

<p>1. The curvature of all the cometic tails when not seen
from a point in or near the place of their motion.</p>

<p>2. The existence of more tails than one to the same comet,
the different tails being differently curved.</p>

<p>3. The phenomena of striations athwart the tail.</p>

<p>It is evident that all these phenomena are such as we
might fairly expect if a comet’s tail is caused by the sun’s
repulsive action on molecules, raised by his heating action
on the head. The matter thus swept away would resemble
smoke, driven upwards from the funnel of a moving steamer,
and then swept in any given direction by a steady wind;
we should see a curved train of such matter just as we see a
curved streak of smoke. If the matter raised from the head
is not all of one kind (and it is antecedently unlikely that
it should be), there would be more than one trail of matter,
if the sun’s repulsive action were different on these different
kinds of matter. Lastly, the striations seen athwart the tail,
as in the well known case of Donati’s great comet, would be
explained, either as due to the observed pulsational manner
in which the envelopes are raised (if matter were raised uniformly
from the head there could be no formation of successive
envelopes), or else as due to the carrying off into the
main tail, where alone such striations are seen, of matter
which, had it freed itself at the beginning, would have been
swept off into the smaller tails, but being as it were entangled
in the great outflow of matter forming the large tail,
escapes later, and when it does, gets swept off at its own
more rapid rate, and there forms a streak lying at an angle
with the direction of the principal tail.</p>

<p>Bredichin has shown that where there are three tails to a
comet, their forms correspond with the theory that the envelopes
raised from the head are principally formed of hydrogen,
carbon and iron, but this, which, if established,
would be the most important physical discovery yet made
respecting comets, seems open at present to considerable
doubt, though confirmations seem to be given to it, in some
respects, by the results of spectroscopic analysis.</p>

<p>To spectroscopic analysis we must in all probability look
for such information respecting comets, as may hereafter
enable us to understand their nature. On this point let us
consider what is said by one who, if not the greatest living
astronomical spectroscopist, is <i>facile princeps</i> in this country—Dr.
W. Huggins. First, however, we must consider
the past of this method of research as applied to comets.</p>

<p>The first successful application of the spectroscope to
comets was made by Donati in 1864—the light of the comet
being then divided into three bright bands, whose position,
however, was not exactly determined. In 1866 Dr. Huggins
obtained two kinds of light from a telescopic comet,
part of the comet’s light giving a continuous spectrum,
probably reflected sunlight, the other a spectrum of three
bands. In 1868 a comet was observed (Brorsen’s) with
more success. Three bands were seen in the spectrum of
the light from the comet’s head, and a comparison of these
with measures of similar bright bands belonging to the
spectra of various combinations of carbon, showed, or
rather seemed to suggest, that “combinations of carbon
might be present in the comet.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In conjunction with my friend, the late Dr. W. Allen Miller,”
says Dr. Huggins, “I confronted directly with the spectroscope attached
to the telescope, the comet’s light with that from inductive
sparks passing in olefiant gas. The sensible identity of the two
spectra left no doubt of the essential oneness of the cometary stuff
with the gas composed of carbon and hydrogen that was employed
for comparison.” “Since that time,” proceeds Dr. Huggins, “the
light from some twenty comets has been examined by different observers.
The general close agreement in all cases, notwithstanding
some small divergences, of the bright bands in the cometary light
with those seen in the spectra of hydrocarbons, justifies us fully in
ascribing the original light of these comets to matter which contains
carbon in combination with hydrogen.”</p></div>

<p>Last year photography was applied to this spectroscopic
work. The spectrum of the brightest comet of that year
was partly continuous, and on this continuous spectrum
many of the well known Fraunhofer lines could be traced.
This made it certain that part of the comet’s light was reflected
sunlight; though Dr. Huggins considers also that a
part of the continuous spectrum of every comet is due to
inherent light. On this point some doubts may be permitted.
It is one thing for special bands to show themselves,
for some substances may become self-luminous under
special conditions at very moderate temperatures; it is
quite another thing that the solid parts of a comet’s substance
should become incandescent. I venture to express
my own belief that this can scarcely happen except in the
case of comets which approach very near to the sun. Besides
the continuous spectrum with dark lines, the photograph
showed also a spectrum of bright lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These lines,” says Dr. Huggins, “possessed extreme interest, for
there was certainly contained within this hieroglyphic writing some
new information. A discussion of the position of these new lines
showed them to be undoubtedly the same lines which appear in certain
compounds of carbon. Not long before, Professors Liveing and
Dewar had found from their laboratory experiments that these lines
are only present when nitrogen is also present, and that they indicate
a nitrogen compound of carbon, namely—cyanogen. Two
other bright groups were also seen in the photograph, confirming
the presence of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.”</p></div>

<p>It is worthy of notice that, only a few days later, Dr. H.
Draper succeeded in obtaining a photograph of the same
comet’s spectrum. It appeared to him to confirm Dr.
Huggins’ statements, except only that the dark Fraunhofer
lines were not visible—the photograph having probably
been taken under less favorable conditions.</p>

<p>So far, then, it seems clear that comets shine in part by
reflecting sunlight, partly with light of their own; the part
of the cometic substance which certainly shines with its
own light is gaseous, and this gas in most comets “contains
carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, possibly also oxygen, in
the form of hydrocarbons, cyanogen, and possibly oxygen
compounds of carbon.”</p>

<p>But the latest comet has brought with it fresh news. Its
spectrum is not like that given by the comets we have been
considering. The bright lines of sodium are seen in it, and
also other bright lines and groups of lines, which have not
yet been shown to be identical with any belonging to the
hydrocarbon groups, but probably are so. Dr. Huggins’
photograph shows, he considers, “that the original light of
the comet, which gives a continuous spectrum (he means
that portion of the original light which does so), was too
strong to allow of the Fraunhofer lines being recognized in
the reflected solar light.” We demur to this as being <i>shown</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
it may fairly be said to be <i>suggested</i>. The cyanogen groups
are not seen.</p>

<p>Such is Dr. Huggins’ account; but it is manifest that this
comet underwent important changes, of which—we are
surprised to note—Dr. Huggins has taken no account.
Thus, in April, Professors Tacchini and Vogel found simply
a faint continuous spectrum. In May, Vogel found that
the three bands associated with carbon were present,
though faint, while there was no trace of the sodium band.
On the contrary, on the nights of June 4, 5, and 7, Dr. B.
Hasselberg, of the Observatory of Pulkowa, found that the
nucleus of the comet gave a very strong and extended continuous
spectrum, with an “excessively strong” bright line
in the orange yellow, proved by micrometrical measurement
to be identical with the D line—the well known
double sodium line of the solar spectrum. The observation
was confirmed by Dunér, Bredichin, and Vogel. On this
Mr. Hind remarks, “It is necessary to conclude that, during
the last fortnight of May, the spectrum of Wells’ comet
had changed in a manner of which the history of science
furnishes no precedent.” It must, however, be remembered
that as yet no comets have been examined under
sufficiently favorable conditions, to enable us to say whether
the change thus observed was really exceptional, or only
exceptional in being for the first time noted. Whenever
such a comet as Donati’s comes favorably under spectroscopic
scrutiny, we shall probably learn something about
these changes which will throw more light than anything
yet discovered on the physical economy of these mysterious
bodies.</p>

<p>What, then, do we know certainly respecting comets?
What may we surmise with more or less probability? And
in what direction may we look with most hope for future
information? We know certainly that, in whatever way
they are formed, the sun excites intense disturbance in
them as they approach him. Prof. Stokes remarks that
these effects, so much greater at a first view than we might
fairly expect in the case of many of the comets observed,
which have approached the sun no nearer than our own
earth does, or not so near, may be accounted for by the circumstance
that comets travel in what may be regarded as,
to all intents and purposes, a vacuum. From Dr. Crooke’s
experiments on very high vacua, we may infer that there is
very little loss of heat, except by radiation. Thus the heat
received by the meteoric components of a comet would be
much greater than might otherwise be expected. Dr. Huggins
mentions, in the same connection, the remarkable persistence
of the bright trains of meteors in the rare upper air,
which sometimes remain visible for three-quarters of an
hour before the light fades, as the heat is gradually radiated
away. “Our reasoning on these points,” he remarks, in his
dry way, “would undergo considerable modification if we
accept the views as to the condition of interplanetary space
and of the sun’s action which have been recently suggested
by Dr. Siemens in his solar theory”—but of course we do
not.</p>

<p>Bredichin’s researches, showing that three distinct curvatures
in comets’ tails correspond to the winnowing out by
solar repulsive action of (1) hydrogen, (2) carbon, and (3)
iron, seem worthy of careful study and investigation. It accords
well with spectroscopic evidence as to the condition of
the matter raised in gaseous form from the nucleus; and if
as yet we have had no direct spectroscopic evidence of the
existence of iron in comets, we know that meteors are
closely connected with comets, and that many meteors contain
iron. Moreover, as unexpected spectroscopic evidence
of the presence of the substance sodium, common in so many
meteors, has been found in the case of one comet, we may
fairly hope that under yet more favorable conditions, the
presence of iron also may be recognized in the same way.</p>

<p>How far electricity may be looked to for an explanation
of cometic phenomena, is a doubtful point among astronomers
and physicists. For my own part, I must confess I
share the strong objections which many physicists have expressed
against the mere vague suggestion that perhaps <i>this</i>
is an electrical phenomenon, perhaps <i>that other feature</i> is
electrical too, perhaps <i>all or most</i> of the phenomena of comets
depend on electricity. It is so easy to make such suggestions,
so difficult to obtain evidence in their favor having
the slightest scientific value. Still, I hold the electrical
idea to be well worth careful study. Whatever credit may
hereafter be given to any electrical theory of comets, will be
solely and entirely due to those who may help to establish
it upon a basis of sound evidence—none whatever to the
mere suggestion, which has been made time and again since
it was first advanced by Fontenelle. Dr. Huggins says that
he finds there is a rapidly growing feeling among physicists
that both the inherent light (which he prefers to call the
self-light) of comets and the phenomena of their tails belong
to the order of electrical phenomena. An American astronomer
recently wrote to him, as to American views of the
self-light of comets, “I can not speak with authority for
anyone but myself; still I think the prevailing impression
amongst us is that this light is due to an electric, or, if I
may coin the word, (far better not) an electric-oid action
of some kind.” On this Dr. Huggins himself remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The spectroscopic results fail to give conclusive evidence on this
point; still, perhaps, upon the whole, especially if we consider the
photographs of last year, the teachings of the spectroscope are in
favor of the view that the self-light of comets is due to electric discharges.
Those who are disposed to believe that the truth lies in this
direction, differ from each other in the precise modes in which they
would apply the known laws of electric action to the phenomena of
comets. Broadly, the different applications of principles of electricity
which have been suggested, group themselves about the common
idea, that great electrical disturbances are set up by the sun’s
action in connection with the vaporization of some of the matter of
the nucleus, and that the tail is probably matter carried away, possibly
in connection with electric discharges, under an electrical influence
of repulsion exerted by the sun. This view necessitates the
supposition that the sun is strongly electrified, either negatively or
positively, and further, that in the processes taking place in the comet,
either of vaporization or of some other kind, the matter thrown out
by the nucleus has become strongly electrified in the same way as the
sun—that is, negatively if the sun’s electricity is negative, or positively
if the sun’s is positive. The enormous disturbances which the
spectroscope shows to be always at work in the sun must be accompanied
by electrical changes of equal magnitude, but we know nothing
as to how far these are all, or the great majority of them, in one
direction, so as to cause the sun to maintain permanently a high
electrical state, whether positive or negative.”</p></div>

<p>Unless some such state of things exist, Sir John Herschel’s
statement, “That this force” (the repulsive force forming the
tail) “can not be of the nature of electric or magnetic forces,”
must be accepted, for, as he points out, “the center of gravity
of each particle would not be affected; the attraction on one
of its sides would precisely equal the repulsion on the other.”
Repulsion of the cometary matter would only take place if
this matter, after it has been driven off from the nucleus
and the sun, have both high electric potentials of the same
kind. Further, it is suggested that luminous jets, streams,
halos, and envelopes belong to the same order of phenomena
as the aurora, the electrical brush, and the stratified discharges
of exhausted tubes.</p>

<p>All this, it will be noticed, is at present merely hypothetical.
It is, however, worthy of notice that <i>outside</i> of electricity
there is nothing known to physicists which seems to
afford even a promise of explanation, so far, at least, as the
grander and more striking (also the most mysterious) of
cometic phenomena are concerned. It may well be that
with our advancing knowledge of meteors and meteor systems,
the spectroscopic analysis of the next few comets of
the larger and completer types—comets like Donati’s comet,
the great comet of 1811, and the comet of 1861—may throw
unexpected light on mysteries which still remain among the
most profound and unpromising problems presented to modern
science.—<i>The Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<p>An early start from Killarney, and a seven-hour journey
by rail, ending in delightful quarters at the pleasant Hotel
Shelburne, in Dublin, gives a comfortable sense of having
passed an agreeable day.</p>

<p>“I would like to have run from Limerick Junction up to
Limerick,” says a feminine member of the quartette.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we missed anything in Limerick; I felt
like stopping awhile at Kilkenny,” answered her brother.</p>

<p>“But Kilkenny comes to America,” said the first speaker,
who had been reading about the enormous annual emigration
from that town.</p>

<p>“Well, I fancy one can have all one wants of Limerick at
home.”</p>

<p>“Not all I want,” said the little woman, perversely.</p>

<p>“What can you want, who have had your full share of
domestic torments, with numberless Bridgets and Norahs?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, but later, in the privacy of her
chamber, she said, “I did so want to go to Limerick, to buy
some Irish lace. You know they make it there, and send
it over to Brussels, and then it is bought back into Ireland
for quadruple its cost”—but the air of mild rebuke with
which her companion looked up from the diary in which
she was describing the beauties of Killarney scenery,
seemed to act as a sudden check upon the purely feminine
outburst. “Of course I know we can’t stop to buy things,”
she added, apologetically.</p>

<p>“Nor can we buy things when we do stop. It’s dreadful
of you to begin to want things so early.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” chimed in a masculine voice at the door, “It’s unworthy
the spirit of a true Chautauquan. Get on your
hats, girls, there’s time enough for a drive, to get what the
books recommend—a general view of the town.”</p>

<p>Our hotel fronts Stephen’s Green, whose twenty acres of
beautiful grounds form only one of six such ornamented
breathing places for that portion of the city which lies on
the right bank of the Liffey, beyond the confines of the
ancient town. Our coachman knows his business, and halts
to point out the equestrian statue of George the Second,
showing through the trees in the center of the square. Then
we must look at the old Mansion House, and at the site of
the great exposition building which stands in twelve acres
of garden, and was, if successful, to have been what the
Crystal Palace of Sydenham is to London. Financially, it
was not a success, and the future use of the building is not
yet decided. We halt again to admire the architectural
beauty of “the finest building in Dublin, if not in Ireland,”
formerly the Irish House of Parliament and now used as the
Bank of Ireland. If it were not too late we could go in and
see the whole process of printing the bank notes. As it is,
we jog slowly on to the eastern end of College Green, which
is entirely occupied by the imposing front of Trinity College.
The huge Corinthian pile covers an extent of thirty
acres. The income is derived largely from landed estates.
Its library of one hundred and thirty thousand volumes
grows rapidly, for the University is one of the five that has
the right to a copy of every volume published in the United
Kingdom. The number of students, usually about two thousand,
is diminished somewhat by the new Queen’s University,
founded by Victoria in 1850, which grants degrees to the
graduates from the Queen’s Colleges at Belfast, Galway, and
Cork. To a company of learners, nothing could be more interesting
than to visit the museums, observatories, botanic
gardens, and printing houses of this great institution, which
has had such an influence on education in Ireland; but, if
we could not see all, we confess to a preference for a day at
the Royal Dublin Society, whose professors lecture to the
public gratuitously, and whose schools in the fine arts instruct
worthy pupils without charge. We want also to see
the male and female training schools, under the charge of
the Board of Education, the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, and
the Drummond Orphanage, owned and supported by a merchant
of that name. Other societies for the promotion of
science and literature are too numerous to name. No city is
more generously provided with the means of education, or
produces more learned scholars, yet nowhere is the ignorance
of the lowest classes more marked. No place more
abounds in charitable institutions. The charity schools
number over two hundred, yet the condition of the poor is
wretched in the extreme. The city is one of striking contrasts,
of grand architectural effects, heightened by the
meanness of the dwellings of the poor. The nine bridges
over the Liffey add greatly to the picturesqueness of the
place, but the water of the stream is as notoriously filthy as
ever. Within a few years some efforts have been made to
improve the sanitation of the city and the hygienic condition
of the poor. Dirty alleys have been widened, model
tenements built and drinking fountains supplied. At enormous
cost the neighboring streams were turned into a valley,
which made a natural reservoir seventeen miles from
the city. Thence the water is brought through tunnels to filtering
chambers, eight miles from town, from which it is distributed
over the city. From the University we went down
Dame Street to the Castle, used since the time of Elizabeth as
the residence of the Lord Lieutenant. Here there are state
apartments to be seen, and music to be heard in the beautiful
chapel, but none of this to-day. The sun is setting, and
as we whirl on past hospital, postoffice, Custom House, and
convents, over the bridge and by the magnificent structure
called the Four Courts, because there are held the courts of
Queen’s Bench, Common Pleas, Chancery, and Exchequer,
there is not time to drive inside the gate of the beautiful
Phœnix Park and look at the obelisk that commemorates
the victories of Wellington. That must be left for the morrow,
as must the old Christ Church and St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
whose ancient archepiscopal palace is now used as barracks
for the police. In this cathedral are the tombs of
Dean Swift and the Stella of his poetry. The structure is
the most remarkable instance of complete restoration of
our day, Mr. B. L. Guinness, M. P., having spent £150,000
in its restoration. He was knighted for his generosity, and
it does not become us to suggest that the sum could have
been better spent.</p>

<p>We shall have to divide into two parties to-morrow, and
while the artist and teacher go to examine the picture gallery
and the schools, the others will get a look at the docks
and the harbor, where, by aid of dredging machines, the
sand is kept at bay, so that ships can now come up to the
quays. Commerce still continues to be important, as Dublin
is the avenue of supply for imports for the midland district,
but manufacturers of woollen, cotton, silk, etc., are
nearly extinct, though the general financial and commercial
condition of Ireland is improved within the last twenty
years.</p>

<p>While Dublin has declined, especially in manufactures of
linen and flax, Belfast, the metropolis of the north of Ireland,
has steadily grown in both. It lies on our route to
the north, five hours from London. It offers nothing in
the common lines of interest, such as churches, museums,
public buildings, and parks that would induce a stay; but
its immense manufactories are well worth any loss of time
a visit may involve. We were shown all through the
largest steam-mill, which employs nearly three thousand
men; and through the immense establishment at Ardoyne,
where the finest linen—that intended for the noblest houses,
whose coats of arms are woven in the web—is made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hand. It was interesting indeed, to see, as in the former
mill, the process from the beginning with the raw flax to
the beautiful completed fabric, and more interesting to
watch the workers, many of them women, young girls and
little children, who live their lives out day after day in the
dust and din of machinery. Their pinched and haggard
faces, their dull, spiritless eyes, and the constant monotonous
motion of their hands made them seem a part of the
machines, and brought to mind with great force Mrs.
Browning’s “Cry of the Children.”</p>

<p>Belfast is a great, comfortable, well-to-do looking city,
with wide, well-paved streets, many attractive public buildings
and substantial homes. We stopped but a night, taking
train to Portrush, <i>via</i> the cozy little town of Coleraine. It
is a journey of about seventy miles, leaving daylight enough
to direct to the picturesque castle of Dunluce, which
stands on an isolated rock a hundred feet above the sea.
The bridge from the mainland is so narrow as to incline all
four of us, like children, “to take hold of hands.” It is a
wild spot, with many romantic associations, if the head did
not swim, gazing down into the boiling waves that have
worn great caves under the walls, so that we could not
stay to hear. We creep back, cautiously as we came, to
our car, a regular bouncing, swaying, Irish jaunting car,
and are whirled on four or five miles further, to see the one
thing for which we are up here on this wild Irish shore—the
famous Giant’s Causeway. This great natural curiosity
has been so often described, that it is already familiar. Its
prismatic columns of stone, rising a thousand feet from the
sea, make a promontory of pillars, each fitted so perfectly
to its neighbor that we can not at first recognize the structure
as a freak of nature. As we look over the whole field,
it is strangely impressive, and reminds one of the towers,
tombs, spires, and strange shapes taken at Vesuvius by the
fields of lava, and the mind takes kindly to the wild legends,
and does not disturb itself with the various scientific theories
concerning the formation. The legends say that the
giant was Fin M’Coul, who built the causeway quite across
the channel to Scotland, in order to meet in fair fight a
boasting Caledonian giant. The giant well whipped, and
the causeway, no longer needed, Fin allowed it to fall into
the sea. It is a pity to hasten here, for the wild picturesqueness
of the spot grows with every hour of wandering
upon the rocks, but we must back to Coleraine, and thence
to Londonderry, where, tired and sleepy, we hide ourselves
away in our cabins on the little steamer, and are carried in
our sleep over the channel to Scotland, breakfasting cozily
in McLean’s old-fashioned, quiet hotel in Glasgow.</p>

<p>And now we are in another world. Here is no lack of
pure water, for Loch Katrine, thirty miles away, pours into
the city no less than twenty-four millions of gallons a day.
Here is thrift, for around us is a city whose trade so increased
that its import duties multiplied a thousand times
in sixty years. Here is the beautiful Clyde, literally lined
with ships, old and new, ships going and coming, ships in
every stage from hulk and beams to paint. Here is a city
alive with honest work, with staunch and loyal principles,
with churches and schools of the best. Her cathedral ranks
next in the kingdom to Westminster Abbey. Among her
philanthropies, one of the latest is specially worthy of mention.
It is an immense depot, with many branches, for furnishing
food to the working classes. They can have a good
substantial breakfast for six cents; a dinner of soup, meat,
potatoes and pudding, for about nine cents. The originator of
this work is Mr. Thomas Corbett, who should find imitators
in every city in the world. Is not this a better work than to
scrape a cathedral inch by inch from base to tower?</p>

<p>With so much that is living and practical to interest,
strange that we hurry away to that which is a matter of
poetic sentiment and association with the dead. Yet there
are, even in our quartette, those who cheerfully turn from the
living pictures of Scotch prosperity, to go and dream for a
day on the bridges and in the shadow of the old Wallace
tower of Ayr. They want to stroll out to the cottage where
Robbie Burns was born, to visit the “auld kirk-yard,” to
grow sentimental, perhaps, over his snuff-box, and to touch
the Bible he gave his Highland Mary. Well, if they will
go, we might as well go along, for, leaving out the poetry
and the poet, what can be lovelier than to be out of doors in
this early September weather in one of the most picturesque
parts of Scotland! The excursion takes only one day
from Glasgow, and when we are safely back, we are only
two hours by rail from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>And here, as we throw wide open the shutters of front
rooms in the old Hotel Royal, and look out upon the deep
ravine that divides the city, and across to the castle-crowned
hills, and down upon the monument of Walter Scott, just
over the way, our cool and quiet ones become eagerly
enthusiastic, and the enthusiasts grow wild. We are sure
we want to stay here a month; we want to fly out to the
nearest circulating library and get all of Scott’s novels at
once; we want to hurry our dinner, that we may go and
explore this wonderful and picturesque old place.</p>

<p>The girl whose outcropping desire to buy things was unanimously
nipped in the bud, ventures to say she “must have
a plaid—a shawl, a necktie, something, <i>anything</i>, that is
plaid,” and receives no unsympathetic reply. For the moment,
struggling Ireland’s forgotten, and all that is not
purely American in us, is altogether and unanimously
Scotch. In this mood we are not slow in finding our way to
the streets, believing that acquaintance with details will
enhance our first impression of the imposing picturesqueness
of the place. Our starting point is the foot of Sir Walter’s
marble monument, which rises slender and graceful
two hundred feet in air. The statues in the niches represent
characters in his books, the “Lady of the Lake,” the
“Last Minstrel,” and “Meg Merrilies,” breaking the sapling
over Lucy Bertram’s head. We had thought to pass by
Abbotsford, having indulged ourselves with Ayr, but here
we find the question recurring, “Can not we take the time on
the way to London to see the home, especially the study, of
Scott—to go to Dryburgh Abbey and stand beside his grave;
and on the same excursion see the Abbey of Melrose?”
Forced to leave the question unanswered, but secretly resolving
to do it, we go as straight as we can, asking many
questions of the guide by the way, to the Castle of Edinburgh,
which frowns down from the precipice on which it
stands with a grim aspect ill-suited to the present time.</p>

<p>The esplanade or parade ground of the castle covers
about six acres. Over the drawbridge, between the low
protecting batteries, along the ramparts we pass to the
strong gate that gives us admission to the inner fort, which
contains the older portions of the castle. In this pile of
buildings on the east side are, what we more specially came
to see, the state apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots, and
the wall down which her infant son was lowered in a
basket. Here, too, we see the crown-room containing the
regalia of Scotland, the crown, scepter, and sword of state,
and the lord-treasurer’s rod of office. From the ramparts
we are shown northward the magnificent view of the
new town, while to the east lies the old town, backed by
Arthur’s Seat. The line of street eastward from the castle
to Holyrood House, contains many of Edinburgh’s most
prominent buildings, both new and old. Near the foot of
the hill is the new Assembly Hall, the meeting place of
the General Assembly of the Established Church of Scotland,
and near it the Church Normal Schools and the extensive
buildings of the Free Church College, and the Parliament
House, whose carved, oaken-roofed hall—the
Westminster Hall of Edinburgh—was used by the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
before the union with England. Near at hand is the
old Cathedral of St. Giles, whose space after the Reformation
was divided into four churches, in one of which John
Knox was wont to preach. We pass near his house also,
and approach the memorial of Scotland’s ancient splendor,
the ancient palace and abbey of Holyrood. The ruins of
the chapel where Mary Stuart was married to Darnley,
and where King Charles the First was crowned, lie behind
the present structure, which was rebuilt after the
destruction of the old palace by Cromwell. The spot abounds
in historical associations. It was a most powerful institution
as an abbey, the abbot holding regular court like other
barons: as a royal refuge it sheltered Charles the Tenth of
France during the Revolution, and as a residence has received
at times nearly all the crowned heads of England,
not excepting Queen Victoria, who sometimes stops here
<i>en route</i> to Balmoral, and who held a levee here in 1842.
Yet of all its associations, that with Mary Stuart is the one
most familiar, and perhaps most painfully interesting to
the stranger. Here are the rooms she last occupied, her
bed-chamber remaining as she left it, here the cabinet
where Rizzio was murdered. These apartments are in the
northwest corner, and the oldest portion of the present quadrangular
building.</p>

<p>But, interesting as is all that is connected with a historic
or tragic past, we must not overlook the city of to-day.
Records of what Edinburgh has been, as found in ruins, in
buildings, in monuments, in books, would require a volume,
and records of her present condition, another. We can only
glance at a few of the more marked evidences of her material
advancement. Formerly she accommodated her growing
population by building higher and higher in the air, but
more recently they have filled up the ravine and extended
in every direction on the ground. Her population increases,
though not with the rapidity of Glasgow, for she has no
great trade or manufacture to attract the rural districts.
The women exceed the men by some twenty thousand. Her
moral condition has been of the best, her sanitary condition
unfortunately of the worst, but great improvements have
been made in drainage and in destruction of dilapidated
dwellings, ventilation of unhealthy courts, and especially in
cleansing of the streets. In this latter particular Edinburgh
is better cared for then any other large town in the kingdom.
While the city has been, like the rest of the world,
wofully behind in caring for the bodies of the healthful, her
numerous hospitals, public and private, testify her kindness
to the ill. Nothing of prevention and everything in the
way of cure seems to be the motto of modern philanthropy.
Churches for souls, university, colleges, every type of
school, free and charitable, for the brain; all stress laid upon
what the people believe, what they learn, what they do, and
what they wear, combined with utter disregard of what
they breathe or what they eat. There is no disregard of
what they drink, however, even in this western Athens, for
Edinburgh can boast larger breweries than any other place
in the world. But then she boasts larger printing houses
and more of them than almost any other. Printing is indeed
her principal craft; scholarship flourishes; learning is
reckoned at its true value; philanthropy is active and earnest,
and the city abounds in monuments of all; there is an
air of vigorous heartiness in the people that is tonic in its
effect, like the feel of a country morning with the first crisp
frost in the air.</p>

<p>From Edinburgh to London we take the Great Western
Railway, one of the best managed in the kingdom. Already
we have learned that we have no more “baggage,” and how
to “own our luggage;” that there are no cars in this country,
but carriages, and “luggage vans.” The man who locks
us in our own compartment is not a conductor, but a
“guard;” we hear nothing of railroads, but a good deal of
“ways” and trains. After days of steady running hither
and thither, to see this, to hear that, to learn the other, it is
agreeable to lean back and doze and dream while the swift
train bears us away from the highlands and the heather.
We sleep in England at the quaint old Roman town of
Chester, and take time enough in the morning to visit the
cathedral, walk through the queer streets where the covered
sidewalk for foot passengers is on the roofs, and the carriage-way
is sunken several feet below the level of the road. Anxious
as we were to reach London, we could not resist stopping
at Warwick for a couple of days, resting at the Old
Warwick Arms, and crowding every hour with a living interest
hardly to be aroused in any other part of England.
For from this point a drive of eight miles through a charming
country takes us to Stratford-on-Avon, and to the oft-described
home and tomb of Shakspere. This is almost
always a white day in the tourist’s memory, for, through all
the delightful drive, at the house of Shakspere, in the room
where he was born, by the desk at which he sat at school,
in the cottage of Ann Hathaway, and by his tomb in the
church, one feels in a new world. A crowd of visitors may
throng the cottage and the house, and one hears all sorts of
chatter, but they and we and all modern folk seem strange
and out of place. And I doubt not many minds have found
it hard to associate the place with Shakspere at all. It
doesn’t suit our idea of the man or his work, and it is hard
to dispossess the mind of the idea that we are lending ourselves
to a little farce.</p>

<p>We drive slowly back along the Avon at sunset, and give
a second day to Warwick Castle and a drive to the ruins of
Kenilworth. In the former we have the best representation
of an old English castle that we shall see; one all the
more impressive because it is the first seen; in the latter
the grandest ruin that England can show. Both have
many historical associations, but we have not yet escaped
from the dominion of Scott, and have just re-read his “Kenilworth,”
and naturally look for traces of Queen Bess, and
of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, whose tomb is in the
Church of St. Mary in Warwick. So we sit down under
the ivy-crowned battlements, and listen while one reads
aloud the account of the five days of entertainment that
Leicester gave the Queen, and imagination peoples the
ruined banquet hall with the knights and ladies fair who
made the place so gay.</p>

<p>Yet, strange to say, such dreams fade as we drive home
to dinner, and find us quite ready, after a refreshing sleep
in the queerest and quaintest of all English inns, to depart
for classic Oxford, which lies direct upon our London
route. Time was when no more venerable and imposing
architectural effect could be found in all Europe than that
produced by the groups of buildings along the main street
of Oxford, belonging to the twenty colleges that make the
University. But, in these latter days, so many of the colleges
have been remodeled, or restored, that the air of venerable
antiquity is entirely lost. Outside the college buildings,
new hotels, a town hall, savings banks, a corn exchange,
and other mercantile structures materially alter
the effect of the place, which owed its character formerly to
the University alone. Among the colleges themselves,
University and Exeter have new chapels, Jesus College a
new Gothic front, Merton’s Library has been remodeled,
and the old gate-house of Brasennose restored. The new
buildings, given at a cost of thirty thousand pounds, by
Miss Brackenbury, the daughter of an old scholar, are very
fine, and the new Gothic building, called the Union Debating
and Reading Room, decorated in part by Rossetti,
from the legends of King Arthur, is a great ornament to
the group. The new Keble College, in memory of the
author of “The Christian Year,” is near the University Museum,
which is the principal addition to the group of buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
which we can not mention in detail. As the most
important of all institutions of learning, Oxford University
must have an interest for every lover of knowledge. Its
origin is not certainly known. Its government is by
statutes, originating with the University authorities, and
confirmed by the kings of England. Its chancellor was
formerly an ecclesiastic, and chosen for three years; now
he is chosen for life, and from among nobles of distinction
who have been members of the University. Its professors
are paid partly by the crown, partly from the University
chest, and partly from estates left for this purpose. Both
Oxford and Cambridge have the privilege of choosing two
representatives in Parliament. There is no end to what
may be seen and learned if the traveler can linger a few
weeks just here. In that event, leave the hotel, which is
very luxurious, but very dear, and take lodgings in some
one of the many comfortable houses, kept for that purpose,
within easy walking distance of the libraries and museums.
There is only one danger, and that is, that the longer one
stays the longer one wishes to stay, and if we should linger
to see one <i>moiety</i> of what we might enjoy, our trip to London
would be indefinitely deferred. So we decide against
the lodging, and take instead—the train.</p>

<p>The one blessed thing about London, especially to travelers
who have rushed through miles of country and crowded
the sight with constantly varying scenes, is that it can not
be seen in a day. We might as well try to eat a life-time’s
Thanksgiving banquet at once, or to grow from youth to
age in a night. London is of all places in the world the one
to stay in, and we have come to stay. Not at any so-called
American boarding-house, not even at the great caravansary
in Portland Place, or down by the Alexandra Gate, but
in our own hired house. A wee place, not far from St.
James in Piccadilly, whose master was once upon a time
head butler to lord somebody or other, and whose mistress
was the maid to my lady. And butler and maid saved their
wages and were wed, and now there they are living in the
basement of this their home, he to wait at table, with an
air that makes our masculine friends feel, as if he were saying,
“Yes, my lord,” and “No, my lord;” and she to keep all
tidy and bright in our tiny parlor and dining room, and the
bedrooms above. Here we can rest until the home letters
are written and the books read, and we are ready to attack
the great city with real zest, happy in the thought of what
it has in store. Our life will cost us half what it would at
the great hotels, where we should meet only the American
life we know so well. English life we can see only in
the streets, in church, in making purchases, in books, and
in its out of door public aspects, unless we are indeed so fortunate
as to have brought letters that shall open English
homes. Then, indeed, we come to know England and the
English in a way to appreciate its best, and to estimate
justly what seem to us some of its worst characteristics.</p>

<p>To its social life, of any class whatever, introductions are
the only key. To its political movements the ordinary
tourist has little access beyond what the newspapers give,
and that he may have at home. To be an eye-witness of
momentous events or of the circumstances that shape a nation’s
destinies is hardly to be hoped. Her history lies all
about in monuments, and ruins, and palaces, and institutions,
volumes in changeless stone. Her general conditions of
prosperity, commercial and other, may be guessed from
what one sees, and, reading backward from effect to cause,
the thoughtful observer may determine something of individual
and national character. Something comes to him by
intuition, something by observation, and slowly, by ways
he knows and ways he knows not, he feels that he is coming
to a knowledge of England, of English people, and
English life. London of all places seems the spot to bide.
He haunts her galleries and walks her streets, and dreams
in her abbey, and sits in her churches, and finds he is claiming
her history as his own. If Americans must live anywhere
out of America, London, with its teeming varied interests,
its thousand worlds in one, is the place for him to
live. What sights he will see there, what things he will do
there, everybody knows. Let art, or literature, or commerce,
or religion, or science be his hobby, he will find
companions enough and to spare. There is room for everything
in London, notwithstanding it is the most crowded
place under the sun; room even for us who, while jogging
along together, yet have each cast our nets in separate
streams. What we shall gather, who can tell?</p>

<h2><a name="MORALS_AND_SORROWS_OF_BORROWING" id="MORALS_AND_SORROWS_OF_BORROWING">MORALS AND SORROWS OF BORROWING
AND LENDING.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By A. DENBAR.</p>


<p>Not the borrowing and lending of money, be it understood,
but only such trifling things as books, umbrellas, and little
personal belongings essential to ease. It is questionable
whether the loan of these things does not involve more discomfort
than the more costly loan of money. If you lend
money, it is to be assumed that you can afford the loss of it,
or that you see a strong probability of receiving it again.
But your favorite umbrella! What other can possibly accommodate
itself so comfortably to your carrying? Is not
its familiar hook exactly the shape you like? Or perchance
you prefer a smoothly rounded knob, and have made a careful
choice, so that any other handle feels strange and foreign.
To some persons these little matters make all the
difference between ease and discomfort. Yet good-nature
will not permit you to see a careless caller start out
into the rain umbrellaless, although the clouds have threatened
all the morning, and the least weather-wise might
have foreseen the need of an umbrella. So you say hospitably,
“Oh! you must have one; take mine!” and then, with
a prophetic failure of courage, add entreatingly, “You will
be sure to return it, will you not?” You close the door, after
watching your umbrella down the street—yours no longer,
alas! for it never returns.</p>

<p>And what about the borrower? Well, firstly, he carries
off your loan in a fine glow of gratitude for your kindness,
and fully intending to send it back speedily. He even goes
so far as to hand it, all dripping with rain, into the servant’s
hand with an injunction, “Take care of this umbrella, for
it is borrowed.” To-morrow he will call and leave it with
graceful thanks. But to-morrow is fine, and an umbrella is
a nuisance on a bright day; it really shall be sent soon.
And how can he carry two umbrellas on a rainy day? So
the tiny germ of honest intention withers under delay, till
in the end the borrower <i>almost</i> forgets that he is not owner.
There is pointed satire to many jarred sensibilities in the
hyphenless advertisement so frequently seen, “Umbrellas
Recovered in Twenty Minutes!”</p>

<p>Vain are all inquiries. You call at his house; it has gone
out on service or has got “mislaid.” And, finally, you
abandon the quest and purchase another. One melancholy
fact you realize: any five-pound note is equal to any other
five-pound note, but no other umbrella suits you so well as
the old favorite.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the comfort of finding a pen that suits
the busy writer. Even the elaborate gold nib may be a
failure; and as to quills, every mending is one in ten on the
chance of being too hard or too soft for a fastidious taste.
Yet the virtue of generosity often requires self-abnegation
to the extent of lending the treasure which lightens labor
with ease of tool. You know perfectly well that the pen
will be ruined for your use by being lent to the friend who
borrows it, “only for a moment,” while he scribbles a hasty
note, or signs his name to the carrier. But just that moment
does the mischief, and you, patiently or impatiently,
as the case may be, resign yourself to a damaged pen, or
waste time in seeking another.</p>

<p>And of books! What about lending books?</p>

<p>Only those who <i>love</i> books can understand the pang of
losing them. A man who handles his book with firm yet
tender touch, who delights to take down his pet volumes
and smooth out the pages for sheer pleasure of the handling, is
the genuine book-lover, and by force of his love he will surely
be the man who will lend, and as surely lose. For it is the
nature of this special attachment that the book-lover must
share his enjoyment with others. Dearly as he loves the
choice volumes ranged in neat order on his bookshelves,
they are but half-used while they are not shared. The
bookish man <i>may</i> be selfish, but it is the exception only;
the rule is that the true lover of books is “ready to lend.”
And so it comes to pass that, at the close of a long, eager
conversation on Robert Browning’s poems, or Froude’s
“History,” or some quaint old treasure long “out of print,”
the generous impulse prompts an offer of the volume discussed.
It may be that the listener suggests that he would
like to know more on the subject. “You ought to read such
passages,” says the happy owner, and the borrower carries
the book home, and forthwith it is mingled with his own
and is merged and lost. Such a thing even as the <i>loan</i> of a
borrowed book is not unusual, though it ought to be regarded
as a social crime. Who that prides himself on his
books has not painful vacancies among them? Here it is
the second volume of an otherwise complete edition of Tennyson—missing!
And there a “horrible blank” tells of
some unvirtuous borrower who has decapitated a valuable
set by carrying off volume number one. These gaps in the
bookcase are a standing grievance, and happy is he who can
preserve his books intact.</p>

<p>Of course a methodical person would keep a list of books
lent, with the borrower’s name in line. But, alas! what
generous soul is methodical—the ready tendency to lend a
book is proof that a man is ready for all risks. Nor will a
well-kept list make our borrowers honest. If a man steal
your book, you <i>may</i> recover it if you prove the theft; but
what is to be done with him who always—yes, always—is
<i>intending</i> to return your precious volume? Your inquiries
are met with ready promises of restoration; he will bring it
back, but his wife is reading it, or he can not just lay his
hand upon it, or some one has borrowed it without leave,
and it will be sure to come back, and then you shall have it
all right. All which things are tests of patience and good
humor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe tells of an orderly Christian man who, recognizing
the Scriptural injunction to “do good and lend,” was
dismayed by the frequent application for loans of tools from
his less thrifty neighbors. Gravely reflecting on the subject,
he finally reconciled order and liberality by buying a
complete duplicate set of tools, which he kept for the purpose
of lending, and when any of these were lent he quietly
told the next applicant that the ax or hoe was already out.</p>

<p>This plan is not possible with books. But, logically considered,
is it not a singular fact that a man who will hasten
to clear himself of monetary debt, if it be but a shilling, will
deprive, shall we not say practically rob, his friend of an
umbrella worth perhaps a guinea, or a book, which no
money can replace, if it happen to have associations for the
owner or be out of print? And this, too, in a fashion peculiarly
treacherous, since he knows the object of loan would
never be lent except on tacit promise of return. The old
adage, so familiar to our childhood,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“’Tis a sin to steal a pin,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much more to take a greater thing,”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>notwithstanding its defective orthodoxy and rhyme, still
requires enforcement on our languid and ill-trained consciences.
Possibly the causes of this lax morality in minor
matters lie deeper than any merely playful suggestion can
reach.</p>

<p>A wise man once stated plainly what we scarcely like to
hint, in these words: “The <i>wicked</i> borroweth and payeth
not again.” And yet we fear things will go on much as before,
in spite of this paper, and men and women will continue
to miss their umbrellas at the very time they need
them, and sigh in vain over an unreturned book, through a
generous disposition “to do good and lend.”—<i>London Sunday
Magazine.</i></p>

<h3>TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL.</h3>


<p>Sebastian and his sister Viola, a young gentleman and
lady of Messaline, were twins, and (which was accounted a
great wonder) from their birth they so much resembled each
other, that, but for the difference in their dress, they could
not be known apart. They were both born in one hour, and
in one hour they were both in danger of perishing, for they
were shipwrecked on the coast of Illyria, as they were making
a sea voyage together. The ship, on board of which
they were, split on a rock in a violent storm, and a very
small number of the ship’s company escaped with their
lives. The captain of the vessel, with a few of the sailors
that were saved, got to land in a small boat, and with them
they brought Viola safe on shore, where she, poor lady, instead
of rejoicing at her own deliverance, began to lament
her brother’s loss; but the captain comforted her with the
assurance, that he had seen her brother when the ship split,
fasten himself to a strong mast, on which, as long as he
could see anything of him for the distance, he perceived him
borne up above the waves. Viola was much consoled by
the hope this account gave her, and now considered how
she was to dispose of herself in a strange country, so far
from home; and she asked the captain if he knew anything
of Illyria. “Ay, very well, madam,” replied the captain,
“for I was born not three hours’ travel from this place.”
“Who governs here?” said Viola. The captain told her,
Illyria was governed by Orsino, a duke noble in nature as
well as dignity. Viola said, she had heard her father
speak of Orsino, and that he was unmarried then. “And
he is so now,” said the captain; “or was so very lately, for
but a month ago I went from here, and then it was the
general talk (as you know what great ones do the people
will prattle of) that Orsino sought the love of fair Olivia, a
virtuous maid, the daughter of a count who died twelve
months ago, leaving Olivia to the protection of her brother,
who shortly after died also; and for the love of this dear
brother, they say, she has abjured the sight and company
of men.” Viola, who was herself in such a sad affliction for
her brother’s loss, wished she could live with this lady,
who so tenderly mourned a brother’s death. She asked
the captain if he could introduce her to Olivia, saying she
would willingly serve this lady. But he replied, this
would be a hard thing to accomplish, because the lady Olivia
would admit no person into her house since her brother’s
death, not even the duke himself. Then Viola formed
another project in her mind, which was, in a man’s habit
to serve the Duke Orsino as a page. It was a strange fancy
in a young lady to put on male attire, and pass for a boy;
but the forlorn and unprotected state of Viola, who was
young and of uncommon beauty, alone, and in a foreign
land, must plead her excuse.</p>

<p>She having observed a fair behavior in the captain, and
that he showed a friendly concern for her welfare, intrusted
him with her design, and he readily engaged to assist her.
Viola gave him money, and directed him to furnish her
with suitable apparel, ordering her clothes to be made of
the same color and in the same fashion her brother Sebastian
used to wear, and when she was dressed in her manly
garb, she looked so exactly like her brother, that some
strange errors happened by means of their being mistaken
for each other; for, as will afterwards appear, Sebastian was
also saved.</p>

<p>Viola’s good friend, the captain, when he had transformed
this pretty lady into a gentleman, having some interest
at court, got her presented to Orsino, under the
feigned name of Cesario. The duke was wonderfully
pleased with the address and graceful deportment of this
handsome youth, and made Cesario one of his pages, that
being the office Viola wished to obtain: and she so well fulfilled
the duties of her new station, and showed such a
ready observance and faithful attachment to her lord, that
she soon became his most favored attendant. To Cesario
Orsino confided the whole history of his love for the lady
Olivia. To Cesario he told the long and unsuccessful suit
he had made to one, who, rejecting his long services, and
despising his person, refused to admit him to her presence;
and for the love of this lady who had so unkindly treated
him, the noble Orsino, forsaking the sports of the field, and
all manly exercises in which he used to delight, passed his
hours in ignoble sloth, listening to the effeminate sounds of
soft music, gentle airs, and passionate love songs; and neglecting
the company of the wise and learned lords with
whom he used to associate, he was now all day long conversing
with young Cesario. Unmeet companion no doubt
his grave courtiers thought Cesario was, for their once noble
master, the great Duke Orsino.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous matter for young maidens to be the confidants
of handsome young dukes; which Viola too soon
found to her sorrow, for all that Orsino told her he endured
for Olivia, she presently perceived she suffered for the love
of him: and much it moved her wonder, that Olivia could be
so regardless of this her peerless lord and master, whom she
thought no one should behold without the deepest admiration,
and she ventured gently to hint to Orsino that it was
pity he should affect a lady who was so blind to his worthy
qualities; and she said, “If a lady was to love you, my lord,
as you love Olivia (and perhaps there may be one who
does), if you could not love her in return, would you not
tell her that you could not love, and must not she be content
with that answer?” But Orsino would not admit of
this reasoning, for he denied that it was possible for any
woman to love as he did. He said that no woman’s heart
was big enough to hold so much love, and therefore it was
unfair to compare any lady’s love for him to his love for
Olivia. Now, though Viola had the utmost deference for
the duke’s opinions, she could not help thinking this was
not quite true, for she thought her heart had full as much
love in it as Orsino’s had; and she said, “Ah, but I know,
my lord,”——“What do you know, Cesario?” said Orsino.
“Too well I know,” replied Viola, “what love women may
owe to men. They are as true of heart as we are. My
father had a daughter that loved a man, as I perhaps, were
I a woman, should love your lordship.” “And what is
her history?” said Orsino. “A blank, my lord,” replied
Viola; “she never told her love, but let concealment, like a
worm in the bud, feed on her damask cheek. She pined in
thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy, she sat
like patience on a monument, smiling at grief.” The duke
inquired if this lady died of her love, but to this question
Viola returned an evasive answer; as probably she had
feigned the story, to speak words expressive of the secret
love and silent grief she suffered for Orsino.</p>

<p>While they were talking, a gentleman entered whom the
duke had sent to Olivia, and he said, “So please you, my
lord, I might not be admitted to the lady, but by her handmaid
she returned you this answer: until seven years hence,
the element itself shall not behold her face; but like a cloistress
she will walk veiled, watering her chamber with her
tears for the sad remembrance of her dead brother.” On
hearing this, the duke exclaimed, “O she that has a heart
of this fine frame, to pay this debt of love to a dead brother,
how will she love, when the rich golden shaft has touched
her heart!” And then he said to Viola, “You know, Cesario,
I have told you all the secrets of my heart; therefore,
good youth, go to Olivia’s house. Be not denied access;
stand at her doors, and tell her, there your fixed foot shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
grow till you have audience.” “And if I do speak to her,
my lord, what then?” said Viola. “O then,” replied Orsino,
“unfold to her the passion of my love. Make a long discourse
to her of my dear faith. It may well become you to
act my woes, for she will attend more to you than one of
graver aspect.”</p>

<p>Away then went Viola; but not willingly did she undertake
this courtship, for she was to woo a lady to become a
wife to him she wished to marry; but having undertaken
the affair, she performed it with fidelity; and Olivia soon
heard that a youth was at her door who insisted upon being
admitted to her presence. “I told him,” said the servant,
“that you were sick: he said he knew you were, and therefore
he came to speak with you. I told him that you were
asleep: he seemed to have a foreknowledge of that too, and
said, that therefore he must speak with you. What is to be
said to him, lady? for he seems fortified against all denial,
and will speak with you, whether you will or no.” Olivia,
curious to see who this peremptory messenger might be,
desired he might be admitted; and throwing her veil over
her face, she said she would once more hear Orsino’s embassy,
not doubting but that he came from the duke, by his
importunity. Viola entering, put on the most manly air
she could assume, and affecting the fine courtier’s language
of great men’s pages, she said to the veiled lady, “Most
radiant, exquisite and matchless beauty, I pray you tell me
if you are the lady of the house; for I should be sorry to
cast away my speech upon another, for besides that it is
excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to learn
it.” “Whence come you, sir?” said Olivia. “I can say
little more than I have studied,” replied Viola; “and that
question is out of my part.” “Are you a comedian?” said
Olivia. “No,” replied Viola; “and yet I am not that which
I play;” meaning that she being a woman, feigned herself
to be a man. And again she asked Olivia if she were the
lady of the house. Olivia said she was; and then Viola,
having more curiosity to see her rival’s features than haste
to deliver her master’s message, said, “Good madam, let me
see your face.” With this bold request Olivia was not
averse to comply; for this haughty beauty, whom the Duke
Orsino had loved so long in vain, at first sight conceived a
passion for the supposed page, the humble Cesario.</p>

<p>When Viola asked to see her face, Olivia said, “Have you
any commission from your lord and master to negotiate
with my face?” And then, forgetting her determination to
go veiled for seven long years, she drew aside her veil, saying,
“But I will draw the curtain and show the picture. Is
it not well done?” Viola replied, “It is beauty truly
mixed; the red and white upon your cheeks are by Nature’s
own cunning hand laid on. You are the most cruel lady
living, if you will lead these graces to the grave, and leave
the world no copy.” “O sir,” replied Olivia, “I will not be
so cruel. The world may have an inventory of my beauty.
As, <i>item</i>, two lips, indifferent red; <i>item</i>, two grey eyes, with
lids to them; one neck; one chin, and so forth. Were you sent
here to praise me?” Viola replied, “I see you what you are:
you are too proud, but you are fair. My lord and master loves
you. O such a love could but be recompensed, though you
were crowned the queen of beauty: for Orsino loves you
with adoration and with tears, with groans that thunder
love, and sighs of fire.” “Your lord,” said Olivia, “knows
well my mind. I can not love him; yet I doubt not he is
virtuous; I know him to be noble and of high estate, of fresh
and spotless youth. All voices proclaim him learned, courteous,
and valiant; yet I can not love him, he might have
taken his answer long ago.” “If I did love you as my master
does,” said Viola, “I would make me a willow cabin at
your gates, and call upon your name. I would write complaining
sonnets on Olivia, and sing them in the dead of
the night; your name should sound among the hills, and I
would make Echo, the babbling gossip of the air, cry out
<i>Olivia</i>. O you should not rest between the elements of earth
and air, but you should pity me.” “You might do much,”
said Olivia; “what is your parentage?” Viola replied,
“Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman.”
Olivia now reluctantly dismissed Viola, saying,
“Go to your master, and tell him, I can not love him. Let
him send no more, unless perchance you come again to tell
me how he takes it.” And Viola departed, bidding the lady
farewell by the name of Fair Cruelty. When she was gone,
Olivia repeated the words, <i>Above my fortune, yet my state is
well, I am a gentleman</i>. And she said aloud, “I will be
sworn he is; his tongue, his face, his limbs, action, and
spirit, plainly show he is a gentleman.” And then she
wished Cesario was the duke; and perceiving the fast hold
he had taken on her affections, she blamed herself for her
sudden love; but the gentle blame which people lay upon
their own faults has no deep root; and presently the noble
lady Olivia so far forgot the inequality between her fortunes
and those of this seeming page, as well as the maidenly reserve
which is the chief ornament of a lady’s character, that
she resolved to court the love of young Cesario, and sent a
servant after him with a diamond ring, under the pretence
that he had left it with her as a present from Orsino. She
hoped by thus artfully making Cesario a present of the ring,
she should give him some intimation of her design; and
truly it did make Viola suspect; for knowing that Orsino
had sent no ring by her, she began to recollect that Olivia’s
looks and manner were expressive of admiration, and she
presently guessed her master’s mistress had fallen in love
with her. “Alas,” said she, “the poor lady might as well
love a dream. Disguise I see is wicked, for it has caused
Olivia to breathe as fruitless sighs for me, as I do for
Orsino.”</p>

<p>Viola returned to Orsino’s palace, and related to her lord
the ill success of her negotiation, repeating the command
of Olivia, that the duke should trouble her no more. Yet
still the duke persisted in hoping that the gentle Cesario
would in time be able to persuade her to show some pity,
and therefore he bade him to go to her again the next day.
In the mean time, to pass away the tedious interval, he
commanded a song which he loved to be sung; and he said,
“My good Cesario, when I heard that song last night, methought
it did relieve my passion much. Mark it, Cesario,
it is old and plain. The spinsters and the knitters when
they sit in the sun, and the young maids that weave their
thread with bone, chant this song. It is silly, yet I love
it, for it tells of the innocence of love in the old times.”</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Viola did not fail to mark the words of the old song,
which in such true simplicity described the pangs of unrequited
love, and she bore testimony in her countenance of
feeling what the song expressed. Her sad looks were
observed by Orsino, who said to her, “My life upon it, Cesario,
though you are so young, your eye has looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
some face that it loves; has it not, boy?” “A little, with
your leave,” replied Viola. “And what kind of woman,
and of what age is she?” said Orsino. “Of your age, and
of your complexion, my lord,” said Viola: which made the
duke smile to hear this fair young boy loved a woman so
much older than himself, and of a man’s dark complexion;
but Viola secretly meant Orsino, and not a woman like
him.</p>

<p>When Viola made her second visit to Olivia, she found
no difficulty in gaining access to her. Servants soon discover
when their ladies delight to converse with handsome
young messengers; and the instant Viola arrived, the gates
were thrown wide open, and the duke’s page was shown
into Olivia’s apartment with great respect; and when Viola
told Olivia that she was come once more to plead in her
lord’s behalf, this lady said, “I desired you never to speak
of him again; but if you would undertake another suit, I
had rather hear you solicit than music from the spheres.”
This was pretty plain speaking, but Olivia soon explained
herself still more plainly, and openly confessed her love:
and when she saw displeasure with perplexity expressed in
Viola’s face, she said, “O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
in the contempt and anger of his lip! Cesario, by the
roses of the spring, by maidhood, honor, and by truth, I
love you so, that, in spite of your pride, I have neither wit
nor reason to conceal my passion.” But in vain the lady
wooed; Viola hastened from her presence, threatening
never more to come to plead Orsino’s love: and all the
reply she made to Olivia’s fond solicitations was a declaration
of a resolution, <i>Never to love any woman</i>.</p>

<p>No sooner had Viola left the lady than a claim was made
upon her valor. A gentleman, a rejected suitor of Olivia,
who had learned how that lady had favored the duke’s
messenger, challenged him to fight a duel. What should
poor Viola do, who, though she carried a man-like outside,
had a true woman’s heart, and feared to look on her own
sword?</p>

<p>When she saw her formidable rival advancing toward her
with his sword drawn, she began to think of confessing
that she was a woman; but she was relieved at once from
her terror, and the shame of such a discovery, by a stranger
that was passing by, who made up to them, and as if he
had been long known to her, and were her dearest friend,
said to her opponent, “If this young gentleman has done
offense, I will take the fault on me, and if you offend him,
I will for his sake defy you.” Before Viola had time to
thank him for his protection, or to inquire the reason of his
kind interference, her new friend met with an enemy
where his bravery was of no use to him; for the officers of
justice coming up at that instant, apprehended the stranger
in the duke’s name to answer for an offence he had committed
some years before; and he said to Viola, “This
comes with seeking you;” and then he asked her for a
purse, saying, “Now my necessity makes me ask for my
purse, and it grieves me much more for what I can not do
for you, than for what befalls myself. You stand amazed,
but be of comfort.” His words did indeed amaze Viola,
and she protested she knew him not, nor had ever received
a purse from him; but for the kindness he had just shown
her, she offered him a small sum of money, being nearly all
she possessed. And now the stranger spoke severe things,
charging her with ingratitude and unkindness. He said,
“This youth, whom you see here, I snatched from the jaws
of death, and for his sake alone I came to Illyria, and have
fallen into this danger.” But the officers cared little for
hearkening to the complaints of their prisoner, and they
hurried him off, saying, “What is that to us?” And as he
was carried away, he called Viola by the name of Sebastian,
reproaching the supposed Sebastian for disowning his
friend, as long as he was within hearing. When Viola
heard herself called Sebastian, though the stranger was
taken away too hastily for her to ask an explanation, she
conjectured that this seeming mystery might arise from
her being mistaken for her brother; and she began to cherish
hopes that it was her brother whose life this man said
he had preserved. And so indeed it was. The stranger,
whose name was Antonio, was a sea-captain. He had
taken Sebastian up into his ship, when, almost exhausted
with fatigue, he was floating on the mast to which he had
fastened himself in the storm. Antonio conceived such a
friendship for Sebastian, that he resolved to accompany
him whithersoever he went; and when the youth expressed
a curiosity to visit Orsino’s court, Antonio, rather than
part from him, came to Illyria, though he knew if his person
should be known there, his life would be in danger, because
in a sea-fight he had once dangerously wounded the
Duke Orsino’s nephew. This was the offence for which he
was now made a prisoner.</p>

<p>Antonio and Sebastian had landed together but a few
hours before Antonio met Viola. He had given his purse
to Sebastian, desiring him to use it freely if he saw anything
he wished to purchase, telling him he would wait at
the inn, while Sebastian went to view the town: but Sebastian
not returning at the time appointed, Antonio had ventured
out to look for him; and Viola being dressed the
same, and in face so exactly resembling her brother, Antonio
drew his sword (as he thought) in defence of the
youth he had saved; and when Sebastian (as he supposed)
disowned him, and denied him his own purse, no wonder
he accused him of ingratitude.</p>

<p>Viola, when Antonio was gone, fearing a second invitation
to fight, slunk home as fast as she could. She had not
been long gone when her adversary thought he saw her return;
but it was her brother Sebastian who happened to arrive
at this place, and he said, “Now, sir, I have met with
you again? There’s for you;” and struck him a blow. Sebastian
was no coward; he returned the blow with interest,
and drew his sword.</p>

<p>A lady now put a stop to this duel, for Olivia came out of
the house, and she too mistaking Sebastian for Cesario, invited
him to come into her house, expressing much sorrow
at the rude attack he had met with. Though Sebastian was
as much surprised at the courtesy of this lady as at the rudeness
of his unknown foe, yet he went very willingly into
the house, and Olivia was delighted to find Cesario (as she
thought him) become more sensible of her attentions; for
though their features were exactly the same, there was none
of the contempt and anger to be seen in his face, which she
had complained of when she told her love to Cesario.</p>

<p>Sebastian did not at all object to the fondness the lady lavished
on him. He seemed to take it in very good part, yet
he wondered how it had come to pass, and he was rather inclined
to think Olivia was not in her right senses; but perceiving
she was mistress of a fine house, and that she ordered
her affairs and seemed to govern her family discreetly,
and that in all but her sudden love for him she appeared
in the full possession of her reason, he well approved
of the courtship; and Olivia finding Cesario in this good
humor, and fearing he might change his mind, proposed
that, as she had a priest in the house, they should be instantly
married. Sebastian assented to this proposal; and
when the marriage ceremony was over, he left his lady for
a short time, intending to go and tell his friend Antonio
the good fortune that he had met with. In the meantime
Orsino came to visit Olivia; and at the moment he arrived
before Olivia’s house, the officers of justice brought their
prisoner, Antonio, before the duke. Viola was with Orsino,
her master, and when Antonio saw Viola, whom he still
imagined to be Sebastian, he told the duke in what manner
he had rescued the youth from the perils of the sea; and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fully relating all the kindness he had really shown to
Sebastian, he ended his complaint with saying, that for
three months, both day and night, this ungrateful youth
had been with him. But now the lady Olivia coming
forth from her house, the duke could no longer attend to
Antonio’s story; and he said, “Here comes the countess:
now heaven walks on earth! but for thee, fellow, thy words
are madness. Three months has this youth attended on
me;” and then he ordered Antonio to be taken aside. But
Orsino’s heavenly countess soon gave the duke cause to accuse
Cesario as much of ingratitude as Antonio had done,
for all the words he could hear Olivia speak were words of
kindness to Cesario; and when he found his page had obtained
this high place in Olivia’s favor, he threatened him
with all the terrors of his just revenge: and as he was going
to depart, he called Viola to follow him, saying, “Come
boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe for mischief.” Though
it seemed in his jealous rage he was going to doom Viola to
instant death, yet her love made her no longer a coward,
and she said she would most joyfully suffer death to give
her master ease. But Olivia would not so lose her husband,
and she cried, “Where goes my Cesario?” Viola replied,
“After him I love more than my life.” Olivia, however,
prevented their departure by loudly proclaiming that Cesario
was her husband, and sent for the priest, who declared that
not two hours had passed since he had married the lady
Olivia to this young man. In vain Viola protested she was
not married to Olivia; the evidence of that lady and the
priest made Orsino believe that his page had robbed him of
the treasure he prized above his life. But thinking that it
was past recall, he was bidding farewell to his faithless mistress,
and the <i>young dissembler</i>, her husband, as he called
Viola, warning her never to come in his sight again, when
(as it seemed to them) a miracle appeared! for another
Cesario entered, and addressed Olivia as his wife. This
new Cesario was Sebastian, the real husband of Olivia: and
when their wonder had a little ceased at seeing two persons
with the same face, the same voice, and the same habit, the
brother and sister began to question each other, for Viola
could scarce be persuaded that her brother was living, and
Sebastian knew not how to account for the sister he supposed
drowned, being found in the habit of a young man.
But Viola presently acknowledged that she was indeed
Viola, and his sister under that disguise.</p>

<p>When all the errors were cleared up which the extreme
likeness between this twin brother and sister had occasioned,
they laughed at the lady Olivia for the pleasant
mistake she had made in falling in love with a woman;
and Olivia showed no dislike whatever to her exchange,
when she found she had wedded the brother instead of the
sister.</p>

<p>The hopes of Orsino were forever at an end by this marriage
of Olivia, and with his hopes, all his fruitless love
seemed to vanish away, and all his thoughts were fixed on
the event of his favorite, young Cesario, being changed into
a fair lady. He viewed Viola with great attention, and he
remembered how very handsome he had always thought
Cesario was, and he concluded she would look very beautiful
in a woman’s attire; and then he remembered how often
she had said <i>she loved him</i>, which at the time seemed only
the dutiful expressions of a faithful page, but now he guessed
that something more was meant, for many of her pretty
sayings which were like riddles to him, came now into his
mind, and he no sooner remembered all these things than
he resolved to make Viola his wife; and he said to her (he
still could not help calling her <i>Cesario</i> and <i>boy</i>), “Boy, you
have said to me a thousand times that you should never
love a woman like to me, and for the faithful service you
have done for me so much beneath your soft and tender
breeding, and since you have called me master so long, you
shall now be your master’s mistress, and Orsino’s true
duchess.”</p>

<p>Olivia, perceiving Orsino was making over that heart,
which she had so ungraciously rejected, to Viola, invited
them to enter her house, and offered the assistance of the
good priest, who had married her to Sebastian in the morning,
to perform the same ceremony in the remaining part of
the day for Orsino and Viola. Thus the twin brother and
sister were both wedded on the same day: the storm and
shipwreck, which had separated them, being the means of
bringing to pass their high and mighty fortunes. Viola
was the wife of Orsino the Duke of Illyria, and Sebastian
the husband of the rich and noble countess, the Lady
Olivia.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_W_C_T_U_BORN_AT_CHAUTAUQUA" id="THE_W_C_T_U_BORN_AT_CHAUTAUQUA">THE W. C. T. U. BORN AT CHAUTAUQUA.</a></h2>


<p>The origin of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union
was prepared, and read by Mrs. W. A. Ingham, of Cleveland,
Ohio, before the national convention of the Woman’s
Christian Temperance Union, held last month at Louisville,
Ky.</p>

<p>The handful of corn upon the tops of the mountains grew
apace after its wonderful planting in Ohio during the winter
and spring of 1873-4.</p>

<p>The fruit thereof shook like Lebanon throughout the Middle
and Western States, and in August of that year, many
of the seed-sowers had gathered upon the shore of Lake
Chautauqua for a fortnight in the woods.</p>

<p>In the primitive fashion we dwelt in tents, or sat in the
open air about the watchfires kindled at the first National
Sunday School Assembly.</p>

<p>Women who had drawn near to God in saloon prayer meetings
felt their hearts aflame again as they recounted the
wonders of the great uprising.</p>

<p>It was at Chautauqua, the birth-place of grand ideas, that
our Union originated.</p>

<p>It is time the story of its beginnings was written, and
there is no more fitting place for its rehearsal than in this
goodly presence—the city of Louisville, where South and
North meet beneath the palm to rejoice over its achievements
and consecrate anew its altars.</p>

<p>One bright day a very few ladies were in conversation
upon the subject that filled their hearts, inspiring the
thought that the temperance cause needed the united effort
of all the women of the country.</p>

<p>The suggestion came from Mrs. Mattie McClellan Brown,
of Alliance, Ohio. Mrs. G. W. Manly, leader of the praying
band of Akron, accepted the idea, and it was said:
“Why not take steps here toward its formation?”</p>

<p>Upon further consultation it was decided to call a meeting,
notice of which was read from the platform of the
Auditorium by Rev. Dr. Vincent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jennie F. Willing, of Illinois, a guest of the Assembly,
maintained that so important a movement should be
controlled by women engaged in active Christian work.</p>

<p>In order to arrange the preliminaries of the announced
meeting, Mrs. Willing invited Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Manly,
Miss Emma Janes, of Oakland, California, and Mrs. Ingham,
of Cleveland, to meet her in a new board shanty on
Asbury Avenue.</p>

<p>The Woman’s National Christian Temperance Union
was born, not in a manger, but on a floor of straw in an
apartment into which daylight shone through holes and
crevices.</p>

<p>In a half hour’s space every detail was prepared, including
a proposed formation of a Committee of Organization,
to take place that very afternoon succeeding the regular
three o’clock session of the Assembly.</p>

<p>At the temperance prayer-meeting at 4 o’clock, p. m., under
the canvas Tabernacle, were, perhaps, fifty earnest Christian
women; of them were several from Ohio, Mrs. H. H.
Otis, of Buffalo, Mrs. Niles, of Hornellsville, and Mrs. W.
E. Knox, of Elmira, N. Y.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willing was leader of the prayer service, and acted
as presiding officer of the business session, convened afterward.
At this conference women were chosen to represent
various States; an adjournment being had to the following
day.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed, August 15, 1874, a large audience
had gathered, Mrs. Jennie F. Willing in the chair, and Mrs.
Emily Huntington Miller secretary.</p>

<p>As results of the deliberation, the committee of organization
was formed, and the chairman and secretary of the
Chautauqua meeting were authorized to issue a circular letter,
asking the woman’s temperance leagues of the North to
hold conventions for the purpose of electing one woman
from each Congressional district as delegate to an organizing
convention, to be held in Cleveland, Ohio, November
18, 19 and 20, 1874.</p>

<p>The call duly appeared, to which the following names
were appended, preceded by those of the chairman and
secretary: Mrs. Dr. Gause, Philadelphia; Mrs. E. J.
Knowles, Newark, N. J.; Mrs. M. M. Brown, Alliance, O.;
Mrs. W. D. Barnett, Hiawatha, Kas.; Miss Auretta Hoyt,
Indianapolis, Ind.; Mrs. Ingham Stanton, LeRoy, N. Y.;
Mrs. Frances Crook, Baltimore, Md.; Miss Emma Janes,
Oakland, Cal.</p>

<p>The writer of this paper was nominated from Ohio, but
withdrew her own name, substituting that of Mrs. Brown,
who was known to have made the original suggestion.</p>

<p>The convention assembled November 18. Mrs. Willing
was chosen president. Sixteen States were represented by
grand women. Lovely crusaders of the city secured entertainment
for three hundred persons; one of them, Sarah
Knowles Bolton, looked after the baggage of delegates and
visitors. The Second Presbyterian Church, Superior street,
held the gathering. An address of welcome was delivered
by Mrs. L. D. McCabe, of Delaware, O., President of the
Ohio State Union, which had been organized at Springfield,
September 27, 1874.</p>

<p>The daily press pronounced the executive ability of the
women to be of high order, all unused as we were to deliberative
assemblies. Universal comment was excited by
the remarkably thorough and able administration of the
presiding officer through three difficult days. The following
ladies were chosen to serve during the year:</p>

<p>President—Mrs. Annie F. Wittenmeyer, of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Vice-Presidents—One from each State represented.</p>

<p>Recording Secretary—Mrs. Mary C. Johnson, New York.</p>

<p>Corresponding Secretary—Frances E. Willard, of Illinois.</p>

<p>Treasurer—Mrs. W. A. Ingham, of Ohio.</p>

<p>As a reward of merit our four faces appeared not long
after, engraved on wood, in the <i>Morning</i>, an enterprising
herald of reform.</p>

<p>Vicissitudes have occurred during the eight years passed,
but all tend, in our onward march to the fore-front of battle,
to bring nearer that which overcoming faith and labor are
sure to win—victory!</p>

<p>An agency thereto which should here be recognized is the
election, in 1879, at Indianapolis, of Frances E. Willard as
President of the Woman’s National Christian Temperance
Union. She leads to glorious struggle the hosts of Miriam
and of Deborah in a new crusade for God and home and
native land.</p>

<p>Our present officers are capable and faithful. Our borders
are extended until now forty-four States and Territories
are each represented by a Vice-President. We have
within this area three thousand auxiliaries. The work is
divided into thirty-three departments superintended by
practical women.</p>

<p>The novices in parliamentary usage of the Cleveland Convention
are now experienced and intelligent leaders in the
grand reform.</p>

<p>Independent, organizations, with large membership, have
multiplied on both sides of the ocean until a score are in active
operation as the outgrowth of the great awakening.</p>

<p>More than all, better than all, the “Rock of Ages” women
are proving themselves worthy of the title, and are praying
to-day even more earnestly than when with sublime faith
they went out into the streets and saloons of Ohio, believing
that ere long our Lord will say to us, “O, woman, great
is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt.”</p>

<p>Before I announce the text I desire to clear the road for
it a little. We are never reasoned out of that we are never
reasoned into. A prejudice is an unreasoning thing, and
oftentimes even the Scripture, holy as it is and much as we
reverence it, excites prejudice. We say, “Well, I don’t
know whether that can be or not.” The truth is, we read
our Bibles small, when we ought to read them large. I ask
you this morning to disabuse your minds of all prejudice
against my subject, and wait until I am through. Do not
wait until I am through, but if God sends a word to you,
be hospitable to it, open to it your heart. If it is true, accept
it; if it is not true, reject it.</p>

<p>The text that I shall read is in Genesis, seventeenth
chapter and first verse: “And when Abram was ninety
years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and
said unto him, I am the Almighty God, walk before me,
and be thou perfect.”</p>

<p>The word perfect is the one that excites prejudice. Now,
open the door, and if there is anything in it that is good
and for your peace, take it. I most devoutly pray that God
will help me to present this passage so it will do you and
me good.</p>

<p>“And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the
Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty
God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.” It is
followed by several other passages, referring to the covenant
which God would make with him. You know something
of the history of Abram, how God spoke to him in Ur
of the Chaldees and called him out to go into a land that he
knew not of. It appears that he listened to the call, and
started with his family for his destination, “not knowing
whither he went.” The Lord directed him. But he hesitated,
so Stephen says, on the borders of the Land of
Canaan, in which were located the Canaanites, the Perizites,
the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were hostile,
cruel, rapacious tribes. For some reason, not unlikely
Abram’s love for his father, he tarried on the border of the
land, and did not go over into it immediately. He hesitated,
as hundreds and thousands of God’s people have
hesitated on the brink of some great cross, or some great
necessity. Abram was my brother, and yours.</p>

<p>He hesitated until his father Terah died, and then went
over into the Land of Promise. After going up and down
the land for some time, until two-thirds of his life was
gone, this appearance came to him. I do not know how
God appeared. If that poor slave-woman says the Lord
spoke to her, and her hoe-handle shone with his glory,
and she heard a voice, “Thy sins are forgiven,” I can not
dispute it. God can speak to every heart, and he has
his way of doing it. God appeared to Abram, God spoke to
him. This is the record, “God appeared to Abram, and
said unto him, I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and
be thou perfect.”</p>

<p>This word “perfect” charmed Abram. He opened his
heart unto it like a rose to the sun. It is a singular thing
that this word perfect excites prejudice in Christian people
concerning its attainment. Yet it is the word. It has been
impressed upon me for one reason, perhaps, because it is in
the line of the Chautauqua idea. There are three thoughts
at Chautauqua, aspiration, inspiration, attainment. In
other words, seeking perfection, looking after it, striving
for it. The artist sets before his mind perfection, the mechanic
seeks perfection, the statesman and the social economist
seek perfection, the housekeeper seeks perfection, the
farmer seeks perfection, all classes and kinds of people are
seeking this one thing. Why should it be ruled out in religion?
Can you answer? It is impossible that there should
be such a thing as perfection of the artist or mechanic, for
God is the only perfect artist and mechanic, but it is not impossible
for men to please God; it is not impossible for them
to be so perfect as to please him.</p>

<p>Look at the limitation of the text. It does not say, “walk
before your fellow-men and be perfect.” I will defy you to
do that. The Lord Jesus Christ could not walk perfect
enough to please men, and they hung him between two
thieves. You may not be able to please your husband, or
your wife, or your employer, in all things. No one Christian
ever walked so straight as to give perfect satisfaction
all around. They that will walk and live godly in Christ
Jesus shall suffer persecution. Our dear brother said this
morning, “When you please everybody, look out, there is
something wrong.”</p>

<p>The man that is at the bottom does not please the man at
the top. He who is at the bottom of the ladder does not
know how it looks at the top, but the man at the top understands
the bottom, because he has been there. You have
seen the boys chase a wagon, and one only is swift enough
to get on, and the others, filled with envy, cry, “cut behind.”
That is human nature. The unsuccessful throw
stones at the successful; the people who are up are envied
by those who are down. Mark the limitation of the text,
not walk before your fellow-men, or even before yourselves
to give satisfaction. I thank God for this part of the passage,
“Walk before me and be thou perfect.”</p>

<p>God is not hard to please. God is not so hard to please as
men; it is easier to please God than to please men. The
most unselfish things you do sometimes are the things that
are most misunderstood. But when God sees you with a serious
intent to please him, he is pleased with it. Let me
illustrate this: God calls that perfection which is our best,
doing the best we know how, and trusting simply in him,
is what God in this text calls perfection. I will venture in
the presence of a great deal of scholarship present here this
morning, to say that the word perfection means vital conviction.
The margin puts it “sincere,” “sincerity.” The
true thought is, being true to your best thought, and that
pleases God.</p>

<p>There are a great many things, of course, that are impossible
to us. We can not have absolutely perfect actions, because
there is no such thing as a perfect judgment, there is
no such thing as a perfect intellect, we do not see clearly.
God knows all about that; he understands it. See in the
103d Psalm the wonderfully comforting words he says: “Like
as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
that fear him. For he knoweth our frame, he remembereth
that we are dust.”</p>

<p>Take a teacher: he has a boy that wants to learn to write.
He sets him a copy of straight marks, and the little fellow
is bound to do his best. Watch him as he goes through his
contortions. The teacher tells him how to hold his pen,
but he never holds it right; it is covered with ink; he sets
his mouth and takes aim at his copy. He works slowly
down the page, and there is a blot here and a blur there, and
a great many crooked marks upon it, but the teacher knows
he has done his best, and he says “well done.” The next
time he does a little better. Finally, after a week upon
straight marks, (there are none of them really straight or
true) he brings in the book, and the teacher says it is perfect.
It is far from perfect, but it is the best that little fellow
can do.</p>

<p>I remember sitting in a house once when the mother said
to the boys, (three of them were there), “It is time to bring
in the wood.” The oldest was about sixteen, the next about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
twelve, and the youngest boy was five. They all went out.
The big boy, perhaps to show off before the new minister,
came in with an enormous load, piled it up, and turned
around to me with pride in his face. The mother looked on
with approval. The second came in with only half as large
an armful, and the mother looked approvingly at him. The
last one came in with but two sticks, and they were so
crossed that he had great difficulty in holding them, and
finally they slipped through his arms, and the little fellow
fell down with them. His mother ran to him and kissed
him, and said, “You have done better than they all.”</p>

<p>I thought is not that about the way our Heavenly Father
does, when he sees us trying to be right and perfect, trying
to keep step with the picket line of our best right, when
he says, “Walk before me?” Faber says, “There is no
place where earthly sorrows are so felt as up in heaven;
there is no place where earthly failings have such kindly
judgment given, for the love of God is broader than the
measures of man’s mind, and the heart of the eternal is most
wonderfully kind.” God is not severe, he is an easy master,
a blessed keeper. “Walk before me,” said he to Abram,
“and be thou perfect; be true to your best convictions.”</p>

<p>May I ask you to follow me a moment or two, to see how
eminently common sensed these demands God makes upon
us are, and how widely they are endorsed by our own internal
consciousness?</p>

<p>There are two relations that we hold: one Godward, and
the other manward. In our relation to God what does he
ask of us? What does the sum total come to? God asks,
first, a perfect consecration; second, a perfect faith, and
third, a perfect love. This idea of perfect consecration is in
the realm of human possibilities. Let me look at it. Does
anybody doubt that a man may be perfectly consecrated to
his business? Don’t we know men that are lost, that are
really dying, wrecking body, soul, and spirit, all that they
have, in business; business in the morning, noon, and
night, so driven with business that they are not acquainted
with their own children? When I was pastor in an inland
city, I knew a great big boy of eighteen, who went to his
mother one day, and whined out, “I wish you would ask
father to get me a new coat.” “But why don’t you ask
him yourself?” said she. “I am not acquainted with him.”
That father had been so driven with business that his son
was not acquainted enough with him to ask him to get
him a new coat. Is not that true? Don’t we know men,
in merchandise, in all the walks of life, that are thoroughly
consecrated to business? Don’t you know some
women that are so absolutely consecrated to the idea of
keeping their house in order, that they do not care for their
souls? In calling off their minds from this everlasting
housekeeping, this C. L. S. C. is a blessing to some women.
Don’t you know women, and some men, who are entirely
consecrated to fashion, and run after it at the expense of
body, soul, and spirit? Does anybody doubt the possibility
of people being consecrated to an idea? Take the inventor,
Goodyear. He lived in the city of New Haven, where I
am acquainted. It is said that this idea of hard rubber
took such possession of him that it took all he had. One
day, when his money and credit were all gone, he took his
axe and split up the bedstead, his bureau, and the chairs
for his fire, and did not succeed after all, until sometime
after that. If a man is capable of this kind of consecration
in a merely worldly aspect, I ask, is it not possible for him
to be entirely consecrated to God?</p>

<p>Take the second thought, a perfect faith. There is not a
woman, if she is the woman she ought to be, that is married,
who has not had a perfect faith in some man, or she
would not have been married. That woman has had perfect
faith in that man, and that man has had perfect faith in
that woman. We show it in the use of money. We do not
discover any want of faith, except now and then we find a
counterfeit. We pay a debt with our money with perfect
faith. We get on the railroad and check our baggage;
wise people do, although once in a while people take all
their luggage in the cars, a bandbox, bundles, and satchels
with them, and it is a great deal of trouble to them. So
people try to get to heaven. Why not check the baggage?
We find it at Chautauqua, or Lakewood, or New York.</p>

<p>You say, “I don’t know about faith.” But you have
faith in some men, and some men would trust you forever.
There are some men I would trust to the end of time. So
it is with friendship; you have perfect faith in men. Children
have perfect faith in their fathers until they are deceived.
When I used to look up to my father, I believed
that he could do anything. When I went to him with my
griefs, I knew, I trusted they would be right; I believed in
him with all my heart. I say if men are capable of perfect
faith in each other in the domestic and social relations,
they are capable of perfect faith in God. I say these things
are written down in common sense and in the constitution
of humanity.</p>

<p>Third, perfect love. Suppose I go into yonder house,
and I see a lady with a sweet baby in her arms, a year
old it may be, just coming to the cunning stage. I see
that woman kiss that child. I say, “Mother, you think
a good deal of that baby.” “Yes,” she says, “I love
her with all my heart.” Suppose I say, “I doubt it,
madam, I don’t believe you do.” She would turn to me
with supreme contempt, and say, “There is the orifice left
by the carpenter in the side of the room for such as you.”
I am dismissed. It is a slander upon her. I see her at
night, when that babe is sick. I see her on her knees
praying, with tears running down her cheeks, “God, spare
my babe!” Day after day, night after night, she does not
sleep. You say it is not a perfect love. I say it is a perfect
love, as perfect a love as she can have for the child.</p>

<p>Do you say men can not have a perfect love for a profession,
so that they can take all and risk all, that they
have so poor an ideal that they can not face the responsibility?
Do you say there is no such a thing as perfect patriotism,
perfect love for one’s country? I believe there is
no greater thing than this on earth, that a man lay down
his life for his friends. A few years ago, how many men
laid down their lives for their country. We know there is
such a thing as a perfect love. When that man to-day
stands by the side of that woman and gives her himself,
and she gives him herself, it is a slander to say that he and
she do not love each other perfectly. You may say it is
imperfect, to be sure; it is limited by human weakness (we
are all earthly and of the earth), but, as far as human
ability goes, it is perfect. Can not we have a perfect love
toward God? We are capable of it on the human plane;
we are capable of it on the divine plane. I think you have
laid aside prejudice against my doctrine, and I speak with
frankness, I think that God demands a perfect consecration,
a perfect faith, and a perfect love, and we are capable
of each.</p>

<p>Let us examine the manward relation. It may be stated
thus: I think it embraces three things. First, perfect truth;
second, perfect honesty; third, perfect consecration. The
thing we can not abide is a lie. When a man tells a lie,
he is like a horse that slips his halter once, you buckle it up
two or three holes tighter next time, so he shall not slip it
again. If he tells a barefaced lie once, you fail to trust him
again; he loses your respect. God desires truth in the inward
parts, God asks that we shall be true to him, that when
we know what is right, we shall try to do according to our
best ability.</p>

<p>The second thing we require is honesty in dealing and
words. Let me tell you, friends, the thing the world does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
not forget, is the sin of not paying your debts. I do not care,
though your profession may be like a great four-story brownstone
front house, and you may have a cupola on the top, if
you do not pay one hundred cents on a dollar, your profession
is not worth the paper on which it is written. You
may be a fornicator, or an adulterer, if you pay one hundred
cents on a dollar, the world will give you a free pass.
One of the crying sins that the world does not forget, is that
some Christians do not pay their debts. A preacher may
preach like an angel, and if anybody says, “He owes me so
and so, and I can’t get my money,” his sermons do not
amount to a great deal. Perfect honesty, this is one of the
things that the Christian Church needs to look at. I remember
a farmer in Dutchess County, when I was pastor
there, who had a fashion of throwing an extra bag of oats on
every load of oats sold, especially when sinners came. A
wild young sinner said to him one day, “What do you do
that for?” “Well,” said he, “I may have made a mistake
in measuring up those oats, and as I am going to a country
that I shall never return from, and I shall meet you at the
Judgment Day, where I am afraid you will be on the left
side, I want things to be perfectly square with you and your
kind.”</p>

<p>We demand this of our fellow-men, and God demands it
of us toward our fellow-men. Look at this man Abram.
The Lord had given him the land, but he took pains particularly
to buy a burying place, and have the money carefully
weighed. When he had a battle with the confederated
kings and brought Lot and his family back again, and the
king of Sodom wanted to give him all the spoil, he stood up
in all his manly integrity and refused to take it. Walking
alone with God, he could do without it. I tell you the man
who walks in this ideal, walking before God in his perfect
truth and honesty, need not fear the forces of the world; he
need not fear to be burned at the stake; he can afford to
have his name pitched out of the world as an enthusiast; he
can afford to be despised.</p>

<p>The third thing is perfect magnanimity, which is nothing
more or less than true gentlemanliness. I love to read the
Bible because it introduces me to so many gentlemen. As
a celebrated infidel writer says about Christ, “he was the
first gentleman of the age.” What is it? It is a gentlemanliness,
a true magnanimity to our fellow-men, making
arrangements for the good of other people rather than ourselves,
living not for ourselves but for those about us, being
polite and careful in all the arrangements of our lives, loving
our neighbors as ourselves.</p>

<p>See that man sitting in the cars, who has paid for but one
seat. He occupies one seat with his feet and the other two
with his baggage. People come in and say, “Is this seat
taken?” He says, “Yes.” I heard a man ask one of these
fellows not a long time ago, “Is this seat taken?” “Yes.”
“Whom is it taken by?” “A person.” “Who is the person?
Have you paid for more than one seat?” I was glad
to see the man have to take up his baggage. Did you ever
see a man carve a beefsteak who cuts off the tough pieces
for his wife and children and keeps the tenderloin for himself?
A gentleman will see that all the rest are taken
care of, and he generally comes out about as good as the
rest; he may lose sometimes, but he wins in many things.
Emerson says a man can not afford to lose his self-respect.
I often think what even some Christian men must think
when they look into the looking-glass and contemplate themselves;
if they would have any recollection of themselves
and their meanness they would not consult the looking-glass.</p>

<p>With these two points—first of all, godward, a perfect consecration,
a perfect faith, a perfect love, which we must admit,
in our inner consciousness, is possible to us; in our
manward relation, perfect truth, perfect honesty, perfect
magnanimity. I believe this covers the ideal. We can understand
the meaning when God says to every man, “Walk
before me, and be thou perfect.” But some one says: “Mr.
Adams, you don’t make any allowance for the weakness of
human nature.” I do. Weak human nature! It is God
that recognizes it in us, and it is God that requires these
things as belonging to it, belonging to weak human nature.
“But you don’t know about our surroundings,” you say. I
may not; yet even in your surroundings you admit that
this is an ideal that is in the reach of every one. “But you
don’t make any theological distinctions.” I often think of
what Dr. Hitchcock said before the Union Theological Seminary:
“Young gentlemen, study theology, yes, study theology,
but preach the Gospel.” I study theology, but I try
to preach the Gospel, theology or no theology. You say:
“This will not stand the straight-edged, extreme sanctification
view.” I don’t care about the extreme sanctification
view. There are two kinds of spurious sanctification, one
so high that no one can get to it, and the other so low nobody
wants it. This kind of the text is in reach of every
one and what every one ought to want.</p>

<p>I propose to show how you may all reach it. (May the
Lord help me!) I think I find it in one single expression
in this text, “Walk before me, and be thou perfect. I am
the Almighty God.” That is, “I am the Almighty God, to
help you walk before me.” If you please God, you can
take the risk about the rest. Do you say, “I am weak.”
God answers it with his omnipotence. Do you say, “I am
poor.” God answers it with his riches. Do you say, “I am
without any useful gift, or I have peculiar surroundings.”
God answers it with that one expression, “I am the Almighty
God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.”</p>

<p>You remember that interview that God had with Moses
when he was about to send him into Egypt. How often
God says, “I am the Almighty God. I am the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” What did he say that to
him for? That he might encourage him to believe in him;
trust him, and encourage him to go out under his might.
I believe “I am the Almighty God” answered every excuse
of Moses. If we put this matter in the hands of God, with
perfect consecration, faith, and love toward God, and perfect
truth, honesty, and magnanimity to our fellow-men,
it will become easy to us, it will become the joy of our
lives, and God will put us down in his blessed book as
among his perfect ones.</p>

<p>Mark what God calls perfect is so different from what
men require. We hear some persons say, “Well, C. is
about perfect.” You go out and tell that thing to somebody
that knows her, and does not like her very much. If
I should believe the things I hear said about some men,
they should be put in jail. But you can not find out that
way: look up to God! Knowing how imperfect we are,
and how poor we are, in all these relations of our hearts
and lives, God has put it down, “I am the Almighty God.
I am able to make you what you want to be.” That is
what he said to Abram. Look at him. You recollect at
one time in his life, under great pressure, he told a lie.
And yet Abram filled the ideal, but it was in spite of that.
Noah was perfect, but he got drunk. Job was perfect, and
upright, and eschewed evil. If anyone will read over carefully
the Book of Job, (and I recommend you to read it), he
will find a perfect answer for all the skepticism of this
present age. Job went so far as to curse the day in which
he was born, and the day when it was said a man-child is
born, and yet he was a man that was perfect in his generation,
and that pleased God. He came out of that immature
condition of ignorance of God.</p>

<p>Mark another thing. You remember in this Book of Job,
with all the hard things that Job said, you can not find a
place where God rebuked him. All he said was, “Stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
up, Job, and let me talk to you. You can not understand
my providence and government. You must trust me,
Job.” So he does with hundreds and thousands. There
was David who wrote the prayers and poetry of the ages.
What a man he was! Yet he succeeded in pleasing God,
not by his sins, but he pleased God. The truth is, the
Bible is a record of bankrupt cases of men who were full of
the wreck and ruin of sin, and yet grew up into this perfect
stature of men in Christ Jesus our Lord. What an encouragement
it is for everybody to seek to be perfect before God.</p>

<p>Let me hasten to the conclusion. The first reason why
we should be perfect before God is this, that God has agreed
to help us, “I am the Almighty God.” He will stand by
in every serious and sincere attempt to be his. If you seek
to keep step with your convictions, if you seek to be true to
your best light, remember that God is with you to help
you all he can. I know about the weight of evil; I know
that when we strike out for the shore, there is some dreadful
undertow that seems to draw us back. I know the
earthly is weak and we seem to be drawn down. But I
answer the whole of it by this great truth in this text, “I am
the Almighty God.” God helps, God will strengthen us.</p>

<p>There is a little thing that occurred in my boyhood, that
has been a great comfort to me many times in the hard work
I have been called to do. When I was about fourteen years
old, and my brother about twelve, my father took us out
fishing on Long Island Sound. We had a poor flat-boat
called a scow. We were ambitious, like all little boys, and
when we turned in to go to the shore, about four miles, I
was entrusted with a pair of long oars, and my brother
with a shorter pair. We saw near us a boat with two boys
in it about our own age, with their father, an admirably
built boat, clean in her lines as a yacht. They were looking
at our boat, and the man said to my father, in a sneering
tone, “You have got a pretty strong crew in there, but
I guess we will beat you to town.”</p>

<p>My father said nothing, but he straightened up and
looked at his boys. How we pulled! They beat us a good
deal of the way; it was their boat; I knew the boys were not
any better than we, for I had thrashed the biggest one several
times. We pulled away, and they were yet three or
four rods ahead, when my father reached out his great
hands and put them on mine, I seem to feel them to-day,
and as I pulled he pushed. We beat. Many a time I have
thought of it when I have been trying my best, my father
pushes while I pull. “I am the Almighty God.” That is
enough for me. All it means is within my reach; all the
possibility it promises is within my grasp; all hope, all
blessedness, all might, all victory through my Father in
Heaven. “I am the Almighty God. Walk before me, and
be thou perfect.”</p>

<p>The second thought is, the glorious independence of such
a life as this. The man who walks before God, who is his
with devout trust, has this as the center and circumference
of his idea: “I will, I must, I shall please God, and he will
help me to follow him.” He understands all. A man
walks through this world with his conversation in heaven.
No room for selfishness, what shall become of me? Suppose
that we could interview those five smooth stones that
David took out of the scrip against Goliath, that we could
endow them with intelligence; every one was willing to be
slung against Goliath. I don’t suppose they would have
whined and said, “I wonder why he picked out such a
crooked stone as that. There is something wrong about
that.” But with this idea of walking before God those four
stones that lay in the scrip were as happy as they lay there
as the one that went whizzing against the giant. Whether
we run, or wait, or stand, or go into the fight it is all one.
Milton says “they also serve who only stand and wait.”
The perfect independence of this life is worth all it costs.
Suppose in order to do it we must have the selfish feeling
in us, like a cancer, cut out. As Mrs. Browning says, “He
who tears his heart in twain, and casts away the baser part,
is richer for his loss.” Painful as it may be, before this
wonderful and attractive idea, it is cheap.</p>

<p>You remember that the River Nile runs one thousand two
hundred miles through a desert land without a single affluent.
How do you account for it? How does that great
river pour its flood through Egypt, and keep alive for one
thousand two hundred miles without a single stream to feed
it? It is fed away back there in Africa, by those giant
lakes, and kept ever full and rich. So it is with the soul
that walks with God. Its sources are in God. He draws
his sustenance, not from this poor world, but far upon the
hillside toward God. As the rivers of Europe, that keep it
alive, are kept alive themselves by the tall mountain peaks
in Switzerland, so a soul that walks with God, that pleases
God, is made a wonderful and everlasting benediction to all
around him, while he lives independent of all. I do not say
that people who are seeking this sort of thing do not feel or
have a need of human sympathy. O, no, they have a great
deal of it. I do not say that this ideal is so often found, but
I believe it is possible. I believe I have made a testimony
for you this morning. I want you to think and remember,
if you want to walk before God, he will help you.</p>

<p>Somebody says, “How about the profession of this thing?”
The Bible don’t say anything about it. That is a matter for
your individual judgment. Your wife will find out about
it if you find it. When I hear a man say hallelujah very
loud, I want to know always how much he pays toward the
Gospel. When I hear a man say he is very happy, or holy,
I want to know how he lives at home, how he carves the
beefsteak. Abram did not hang out any sign, but he became
so powerful that the kings all around wanted to make
an alliance with him. If you are keeping step with the best
ideal, it will show in the carefulness and kindness of your
replies, in the grasp of your hand, in the intelligence and
sweetness of your face. O, my friends, may I entreat you
to set this before your eyes? I believe it is the ideal of God
for man. “Walk before me, and be thou perfect.” He will
help you as my father helped me to pull the boat. He will
help you as every good, kind and gentle mother helps her
child. He will help you every time. It will not be a flash
and then over. He will make you happy, joyful and independent
by day and night. Never mind the circumstances,
you will be wrapped in arms so soft and hovered in a love
so deep, it will not leave a desire in your souls unsatisfied;
there will be such choral harmonies within, that the babel
tongues of this world will not overpower them.</p>

<p>Some one may say, “But, Mr. Adams, how?” I say in a
word, go to God and ask him, get yourselves humble; be
truly penitent; be honest and sincere. Lay your hand in
the hand of the Lord. You need not hypothecate any experience.
You can not tell whether you are going to live
long or not, but you can live with your hand in his.</p>

<p>If a sinner has heard me this day, he knows that this life
is the life he wants. I spoke to a sinner the other day,
“John, why don’t you give your heart to God?” “Oh,”
said he, “I am sick of you Christians.” Said I, “Don’t
you think there are Christians in the world?” “Well, that
is a hard question.” “But, don’t you think there are Christians?”
“Well,” said he, “I am not going back on my old
mother.” “Didn’t you promise her to be a Christian?”
“Yes, I believe I did.” “Why don’t you do it?” “Why
there are so and so that owe me. I don’t want any of their
Christianity, but I believe your kind of Christianity is
true.” I believe John will give his heart to God. That is
the kind that everybody wants. Nobody wants these poor,
barren, lean kind, but we want this royal kind, that which
fits and satisfies the feeling of our hearts.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>I must close with one remark. It is a great and intense
age; it is such an age as has never come to the world before.
Some of the preceding ages have surpassed this in
some respects, it is true, but men have never achieved as
they are doing to-day. This great age demands a great
piety; it demands deep, wide-spread spirituality. Let me
tell you it again; a great age demands great Christians,
Christians like Abram, Christians like Paul, Christians like
John. Who will set themselves apart to do battle of the
royal sort? To keep step with the spirit of the age? It is
an age of culture. Education is the cry. There is such a
thing, however, as using up your heart by giving too much
education to your head. If you guard your heart with this
ideal it will be all right. Oh friends, have your hearts
filled with God! Follow this great idea to be perfect before
God, that you may stand in the advance of the age, and
may even run ahead of it. I say that an age like this, an
age of lightning, steam, force, and advance in every department
of human knowledge, demands that the men and
women of the Christian Church should rise to the loftiest
ideal of the Christian life. All the sublime achievements
of Christian faith lie in the line of fidelity to your advanced
convictions. It is the inspiration of souls, it makes
the greatness of life. It is that which has made all the
grand Christians in the world. It is that which will make
Chautauqua grow from year to year in spiritual development,
and surround it with a great light, as an aureola, and
place it at the head of this great age.</p>

<p>Men and women of Chautauqua, let an unworthy servant
of the Master, my Master the Lord Jesus Christ, whose I
am and whom I serve, get down at your feet and beseech
you to meet the greatness of this ideal. It is not enough to
be a ship, it must be launched. It is not enough to
have all these great qualities that God may give to you, you
need to be consecrated. Hear the word of God to Abram
amidst the din and clatter and roar of this age, hear him
say, high out of the clear heavens, “I am the Almighty
God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.” And that this
may be your and my happy lot, is my earnest prayer.</p>

<p>Read all of the required books for outlook and inspiration
but <i>study</i> one of the books at least for discipline. Read it
as you do the rest. Read it more carefully than you read
the rest. Read it over and over. Read it to recall what
you read. Read it with critical helps of every kind. Having
read it <i>think</i> about it. Think <i>and</i> think. Think beyond
it. By some thought in it be led out to some other
thought not in it, but thought of because of the book.
Such chosen book out of each year’s list will become dearer
to you than all the rest and will make the mere reading
of all the rest more profitable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Which book shall I select out of the “required” list for
1882, to read thus thoughtfully and critically? All need
not choose the same. Follow your “bent.” Take a part of
one of the larger books. Begin with a limited amount.
Try pages 124-199 in Prof. Wilkinson’s preparatory “Greek
Course in English,” or choose one chapter in Bishop Warren’s
“Recreations in Astronomy,” or one period in “Geology,”
or “Evangeline.” Try the plan.</p>

<p>Have you seen Prang’s C. L. S. C. Mottoes? Three of
them at one dollar each. In exquisite taste. He issues
nothing finer. Friends of C. L. S. C. people could do no

mottoes, in Prang’s best style, on the Christmas tree. A
good idea!</p>

<p>Pardon a personal suggestion. Nothing gives to the Superintendent

<p><i>Michigan.</i>—I have been teaching school in one of the
burnt districts, Huron county, Michigan. The school was
very large, and the school house very small, and my school
work, with a three-mile walk morning and evening, made
me feel too tired to study much at night; but, I am very
glad to say, I have finished my second year at last, and am
ready to commence my third. I commenced the course
when I was sixteen, and at almost the same time began
teaching. The course of study was just what I needed.
It has helped me very much, and I do not intend to be discouraged,
even if one year does creep into the next. I have
read and studied alone. The nearest local circle, and, I
think, the only one in Huron county, is at Port Hope, several
miles from my school.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New York.</i>—A lady writes: As I am a printer, and use
my eyes all day and every day in the week, setting type, I
am not sure I shall be able to stand examination, but I am
enjoying the Chautauqua course very much.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Illinois.</i>—The Chautauqua readings are a great blessing to
me, as well as to the world at large. I have a great many
days of illness. I can not walk or use my hands or arms
much, and am prevented from benefiting my kind, except
by trying to be patient under my sufferings, and in learning
to <i>wait</i>. The Woman’s Missionary Society of our little
church meets in my room, and I preside over the few ladies
as best I can, endeavoring to imbue them with the spirit of
missions, and aiding them in studying the mission fields
intelligently.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Connecticut.</i>—I’ve had to do the most of the work during
vacations, which accounts for my being behind. I thoroughly
believe in the plan, as much to <i>quicken</i> and <i>keep
alive</i> college graduates as anything else, just what <i>they</i>
need. I found that for me it bridged over many a break
and filled up many an awkward opening left by a college
course. And I must further avail myself of odd minutes
for systematic reading in the line of special courses. An
uneducated dry-goods clerk, to whom I told the plan, said
he could not express his pleasure in knowing of the scheme,
and that it was an incentive, such as he had never known
before. He joined this term.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Ohio.</i>—I find on my floor beside me now “Elizabeth’s
Progress to London,” from Abbott’s book—in effigy—made
from building blocks, with octagon wheels and elegant
chariot, a gay dolly on a made-up chair, with dainty
parasol over her. This his majesty, Master Harry, tells me
is Queen Elizabeth, and he tells everybody she had a thousand
dresses and ought to have been very good. At the
right I see cavalry, extractions from Crandall’s menagerie,
one steed mounted with an athlete in costume and the feet
secured by small blocks. This they proclaim for “William’s
horse stepping on embers.” They’ve been at Abbott’s book
I see, and so we may be called a family as well as local
circle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Massachusetts.</i>—I like the course very much and have
seen many things in the <span class="smcap">Chautauquan</span> in praise of it by
the students. But one thing, which I think will be a great
help to me, I have not seen mentioned, that is the use of
the books for reference. If in our hurry we are not as
thorough as we would like to be, I think we can remember
enough when we find things in our future reading we do
not understand, to know which book and where in it to find
the information we need. I feel very thankful for the
privileges of membership in the C. L. S. C.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Tennessee.</i>—I must send you a few words of thanks for
the C. L. S. C. I have only been a member one year, but I
don’t know how I could do without the reading now. I
think I am growing in knowledge—yes, and in the love of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. With the new year’s
reading I begin life with fresh hope to attain a greater
height in the study of God and his works.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>California.</i>—The C. L. S. C. has been an unspeakable
blessing and comfort to me. It has been an eye-opener, a
mind-opener, and a soul-opener in the deepest and broadest
sense of the word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New Jersey.</i>—The diploma received; it is a beautiful memorial
of the C. L. S. C., which I shall greatly prize, and to
whose value I shall seek to add, year by year, in the form
of “seals” you are so good as to bestow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Minnesota.</i>—I found among my daughter’s papers—Miss
Harriet A. Lathrop, a member of the C. L. S. C.—a blank
for examination, with an earnest request to hear from her
as to her progress. This is to inform you that she passed to
her final examination and was promoted May 7th last.
She struggled with disease for three years, and then, having
fought a good fight, she received the crown of life. I desire,
if you please, that you record on your register, not that
she fell out by the way, but that she pursued the course as
long as she had strength, and then entered into rest. It
was through no indifference that she did not respond regularly,
but from sheer physical inability. She was patient,
faithful, true, tried, and trusty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Massachusetts.</i>—My letter will inform you of the death
of a member of the C. L. S. C.—Miss Mary Thurber, of this
place [Attleboro]. She was about twenty-three years of
age, a young lady of rare value; beautiful, physically and
intellectually, and of fine spiritual attainments. She was a
helpful member of the M. E. Church, and a teacher in one of
our public schools. She had a large circle of friends, but
in her home, among her brothers and sisters, she was the
fixed star whose brightness hallowed, and the special joy of
her parents. She suffered intensely for a few days only,
and though shut out from her friends from the contagiousness
of her disease (diphtheria), she was patient to the last,
and passed from this to her higher associations in peace,
last March. She was very devotedly attached to the C. L.
S. C., read with eager enthusiasm, and worked for and expected
great results from her connection with it. How
blessed that the hope of immortality opens up to those who
are seeking broader fields of truth, and assures fuller development
to the hedged in of time! The entire community
sympathize with the sorrowing family.</p>

<p>The growth of the C. L. S. C. has been without restraint
of any kind. The organization is simple, but few officers, a
brief constitution, and indeed none of the paraphernalia is
required which we usually find dictated from the center of
a wide-spread organization. No creed to sign, no shibboleth
to pronounce. A person has simply to make out an application
for membership, send it to Miss Kimball at Plainfield,
N. J., and then read the books. It was natural that
kindred spirits, doing the same work, should invent local
circles, which, while they are not required, yet are helpful
to the students. Mind coming in contact with mind will
produce an intellectual quickening. Students will get more
out of the books by a system of questioning. Bonds of
union will be created by meeting together, and the
strong will have opportunity to help the weak, and the
weak will learn to appreciate the local organization because
of the real helps it affords them in their studies. We invite
secretaries to send us carefully prepared reports of the work
done in their local circles. Do this for the benefit of others.
The calls upon us are numerous for information about how
to conduct local circles to make them interesting and
profitable. Below we furnish our readers with some suggestive
items sent us from flourishing circles. They will bear
studying and in most instances are worthy of imitation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is the fifth year of the local circle in Oswego, N. Y.,
and it numbers about twenty-five members of all denominations,
and meets every Monday evening. We bring nearly
all our studies into the circle meetings in this way. Each
Monday evening a lesson is announced by the President to
be studied the following week, and a member appointed to
act as teacher, who conducts the lesson on the appointed
evening, using maps, blackboard, etc., having a regular
class drill. A good deal of enthusiasm and interest is manifested.
A critic is appointed each month. We have a literary
committee, which reports each week with selections
from poetic or prose writers. This committee is appointed
each month. We have adopted a new plan of arranging
the lessons, which distributes this part of the work among
the members. A member is assigned, for instance, the
work on geology with instructions to divide it into lessons,
which is done and a report handed to the president, with
the name of member opposite each lesson to act as a teacher.
We occasionally have social gatherings at the homes of
members, one of the most enjoyable of which was the art
social of last winter. A resolution has been adopted naming
our circle “Markham C. L. S. C. of Oswego,” in honor
of Rev. W. F. Markham, who organized our circle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. in Augusta, Me., made no effort
to form a local circle here till April, 1882, when the
Rev. Dr. J. H. Vincent was present and gave us a talk on
the C. L. S. C. work. The outgrowth was a strong sentiment
in favor of forming a circle here, and after several preliminary
meetings, a local circle was organized September
25. At the last meeting, October 10, the membership
was increased to twenty-seven. On that evening we had
essays, questions and conversation upon the reading in the
course. The order of exercises is prepared by the committee
of instruction, and is varied in character, only confining
the topics to the subjects of the required reading.
We have decided to hold meetings once in four weeks. The
members anticipate a very interesting winter’s work.</p>

<p>Our circle in South Marshfield, Mass., was not organized
till a year ago, although we were then beginning the third
year of our course. Our organization was a direct result
of the Round-Table held at Framingham Assembly. We
meet every week. The required readings are divided into
six parts; each member takes one, on which she prepares
questions for the next meeting; the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
are read, and parts of the little text-books. The
meetings are enlivened by the reading of two or three short
essays, and by relating interesting incidents suggested by
the lesson. We sometimes sing C. L. S. C. songs, and have
readings from standard authors. Our meetings are usually
closed by playing one of the Chautauqua games, which we
consider not only pleasant, but healthful, as they give us a
constant review of our work. We organized our circle this
year the first of September, instead of the first of October,
in order that we might take up the whole of the first volume
of Grecian history, and have found that our interest is continually
increasing, and our meetings this year are even
superior to those of the previous year. By circulating the
“Hall in the Grove,” we have gained one new member, who
seems intensely interested.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Michigan City we have a membership in our local
circle of twenty-eight, twenty-three of whom intend to read
the entire course, and five will do as much of the work
as they can. The officers are president, vice president,
and secretary. Our method of work is, no doubt, similar
to other circles. We meet twice a month to review the
work. Members are given topics to study and to prepare
to ask the circle such questions as they may formulate. In
this way the work is not left for a few to carry on, but all
become interested and active working members.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our local circle of the C. L. S. C. in Bradford, Pa., is one
of several in this place, and is designated the “Longfellow
Class,” in distinction from the others. We have limited
our number to ten members, thinking by that means to promote
individual interest. We have but two officers, a president
and secretary. We meet weekly, at the homes of the
different members. We have no leader appointed for the
year, but every four weeks one member of the class is
elected conductor of exercises for the ensuing month. The
manner of reviewing the lessons varies. The conductor
sometimes asks questions, when the topics are freely discussed
by all; sometimes the subjects are apportioned to
individual members to be talked over, or a synopsis of certain
portions given by them. At the close of the lesson,
fifteen minutes is devoted to discussing all rhetorical errors
made during the evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Minneapolis, Minnesota, “Centenary Circle” numbers
about thirty members. The officers are president, vice
president, secretary and treasurer. Meetings are held at
the house of the secretary on the first and third Wednesday
evenings of the month. Thus far this year the president
has conducted the meetings, asking each member of the
class questions on the lesson, from which discussions often
arise. Last year members of the class were sometimes asked
to conduct the meeting. No essays were ever written, but
sometimes each member was asked to be prepared on given
topics to be recited at the next meeting. No concerts or public
entertainments have been given, nor did we observe any
of the memorial days except Longfellow’s. We were quite
in the dark about the work when we commenced, but very
anxious to take up some systematic course of reading, and
would not give it up now for any consideration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Hockanum, Connecticut, C. L. S. C. met informally
last year, and was organized September 25. Three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ago there was but one member of the C. L. S. C. in the
place, the year following three, and last year six. Our
membership is now eighteen, and the interest both excellent
and increasing. The circle meets every Monday evening
at the house of the secretary. At 7 p. m. promptly a
brief Scripture reading and prayer opens the meeting.
After a few moments given to business, the questions in
the text-book and <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> are asked, and a
record kept of those who have done the week’s required
reading and memorizing. We are notified that many and
varied are the household duties performed with the little
text-book perched in divers nooks. The president appoints
four readers and a critic for each evening. The reading is
selected from some portion of the weekly required reading.
This is followed by questions, remarks, or general conversation
relative to the subject, etc. The reading closes at
nine o’clock, after which we have music and a social chat.
The circle has arranged and entered upon a course of ten
public lectures on Geology, given every Wednesday evening
by the president, in the vestry of the Congregational
Church. The occasion is made interesting by the use of
black-boards, maps, the Packard plates, neatly mounted on
easels, and a cabinet of rocks and shells illustrative of
Dana’s “Geologic Story Briefly Told.” The room is also
made cheery by a conspicuous grouping of the class mottoes
framed in gilt, and other ornamentation luminous
with the monogram, C. L. S. C. The attendance is good,
and the attention held closely by the youthful tyro who
has won laurels by his clear and happy presentation of the
subject. It is always a most instructive and enjoyable
evening to the circle and their friends. Our circle early
voted to observe “Memorial Days,” the observance to fall
on the regular evening nearest memorial date. For Bryant’s
Day we have arranged for two essays by young ladies,
one on the life, the other on the works of the poet. The
other members are each to give recitations of choice or favorite
selections from Bryant. We are looking forward to
a pleasant social time.</p>

<p class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Norwalk, O.</span>, October 30, 1882.<br />
</p>

<p>We have held two regular meetings of our circle since
November 1st and we are now fairly at work. The membership
has more than doubled in the last two meetings and
may double again before the books are closed. There never
was a time before when the circle was under half so good
headway at this time of year. Members who are joining
now are doing so more understandingly than it was possible
to do in the experimental stage of the C. L. S. C. and the
results are proportionately more reliable. We meet once in
two weeks in a music store at 7:30 p. m. and close at 9 p. m.
Our order of exercises is prayer, roll, minutes, business, program,
adjournment. We have the geological charts and
begin to realize the need of a suitable place of meeting
where we can accumulate maps, charts, cabinet and museum;
we need just such a room in connection with and a
part of our public library, convenient of access and open to
visitors on this and all other occasions. There could
scarcely be found a city whose people would more appreciate
such a resort. Norwalk has a very fine public library,
and the librarian states that since the organization of the
various reading circles there has been a revolution in the
class of books in demand; that while the lighter literature
is seldom called for, standard works, shelf-worn for years,
are now in frequent use; that she knows from the effect on
the library that a change has come over the reading public.
So far as we are able to discover from reports elsewhere, our
circle rather excels in developing the individual talent of
its members. In our entire circle there will probably not
be one who will not present one or more topics in papers or
addresses during the year, as time permits, and equal opportunity
is given to all. Our plan is to follow down the class
roll, beginning at the top, and the leader is handed a list of
ten or twelve names from which he selects six or eight persons
to whom he assigns topics, the roll itself being prepared
for that purpose. Each member is expected to make a
minute of all the topics assigned that he may prepare for
the conversation, or visiting and questioning which follows
each topic. From five to eight minutes is allowed for each
paper, address, selection or conversation, and the president,
who keeps an open watch, is expected to give notice when
the time is up to persons not otherwise aware. The roll is
prepared with a margin at the top for dates, and the presence
of each member is marked with a cross, while those
late are marked with a diagonal line; each person who
discharges program duty is marked with a dot supplementing
the cross of that date. The next list is made as the first,
passing over the dots, always working the roll from the top
and leaving it complete. The minutes are kept on the body
of each page, leaving the margin on the left of the red line
for anything intended for an annual report, such as number
in attendance, number of visitors, number of members and
a list of those in program numbered, opposite whose names,
in the regular minutes, are their topics or themes. In this
way a complete record of each member is kept, and by referring
from each dot to the minutes of that date an individual
or annual report can be readily made which otherwise
would be tedious at least. Our officers and leaders are
elected by ballot and we rely entirely on the leader to conduct
the exercises as he thinks best. Last year, from a list
of forty-six names, thirteen were reading for diplomas; this
year, with a present membership of forty-one, thirty-six are
reading for seals or diplomas, twelve having graduated in
1882.</p>

<p>77. Q. After this had been done what action was taken as
to the rank and file? A. The men were called together and
stoutly harangued by three men in succession, Xenophon
being the last.</p>

<p>78. Q. What was one of Xenophon’s heroic propositions
that was agreed to? A. To burn everything they could
possibly spare on the homeward march.</p>

<p>79. Q. What answer did they return to Mithradates, a
neighboring Persian satrap, when asked to know what their
present plan might be? A. If unmolested, to go home, doing

<p>88. Q. Into what country did the Greeks next advance?
A. The country of the Taochians.</p>

<p>89. Q. With what difficulty did they here meet? A.
Great difficulty in obtaining a supply of provisions.</p>

<p>Dr. Wm. M. Blackburn, of Cincinnati, was at once introduced,
and delivered the following address:</p>


<h3>“HOW ENGLAND MAINTAINED HER NATIONALITY DURING
THE MIDDLE AGES.”</h3>

<p>Several persons have asked me in regard to the method
of studying history by maps, that is, by making your own
maps as you go along. If I had time I would like to talk
about that, and I will explain it to anybody who wishes to
know more about it. What I would do is this: if I were
studying, for example, the history of Greece, I would read
over some period, some particular part of it, an epoch—no
matter what you may call it. I would get a good map of
Greece, lay some thin paper over it, and trace the map over
it in colored inks. Upon that map you put the events of
that period or era, and then make another map of another
period or era; stitch them all together. Perhaps you will
never look at them again, but you have got them in your
mind. That is all you want.</p>

<p>Now to the lecture. We have seen in outline how Britain
became English, and how England became Christian; how
the Church was unified; and how the unification of the
English people was fairly begun. So we have an English
Church, and an English Nation, with a capital “N.” Now,
how were these to be carried through the Middle Ages?
Let that be our main question to-day.</p>

<p>In general the means were these: wiser kingship, resistance
to enemies, incorporation of new national elements
(do not gnash on me if I do not always “nash” that way),
improvement of the constitution, as seen in the Magna
Charta and the House of Commons, and the reforms in the
church. These means I shall treat under seven points, and
if I do not get through the seven I will get through as
many as I can.</p>

<p>1. Wider, broader and superior kingship. This begins
with Alfred, the first really great king, and the only
Christian king that was ever styled the Great. All his life
was one of illness, yet he always maintained a cheerful, a
devout spirit, and a busy hand. He reminds us of King
David in his various trials and activities.</p>

<p>Now some of the things which Alfred did were these: in
national affairs he tried to rescue, defend, unify, and greaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
England. He was an organizer; he created a navy. He
made good roads. He repaired fortresses. He brought
London from the ashes; he started it on its way to universal
commerce. His long-lost and curious jewel bears the
words “Alfred made me.” And this might almost be said
of England. Her realms became one nation, that is the
southern realm. The old Britons were in the west.</p>

<p>Thomas Hughes has written a life of Alfred the Great;
this is the best one you will find concerning him. I presume
you have read it. He worked his way out of ignorance;
he gave an impetus to popular education and
literature; I do not believe that he was unable to write.
Why, in those days it was not considered to be the manly
and royal thing for a man to write his own name; he had a
servant to do that. Sometimes he simply put a sign there;
the sign of the cross, a mark. Now that is what is meant
by a man signing his name. It does not mean that he could
not write it, but the man who can write subscribes his
name.</p>

<p>His schemes of education were vast; they were the last
vigorous attempt at popular enlightenment in the Middle
Ages. I have not time to dwell on all these things, but you
will remember that Alfred gave a great impetus to the study
of the Scriptures, and that from him and his co-laborers
came a version of the Psalms and other portions of the
Scriptures. Then his education recognized the supremacy
of the moral law. He believed in the ten commandments and
he worked them into the laws. Labor on Sundays was forbidden.
Women of every class were carefully protected
from insult; monks must not be idle and vicious; they
must go to work educating people in the villages. He made
out a rule for his aldermen to attend the schools or resign
their offices; and that was a good thing for the aldermen.
If they would not go to school, they resigned; and that
was a good thing for the people. The clergy must have
wives; bishops must visit among the dioceses, visit and
preach to some purpose. In all respects his laws were designed
for the greatest good of the greatest number. Judges
must be hung if they caused the scales of justice to be
swayed by bribes. He probably did not introduce, but
probably modified, trial by jury. In those days the jury
was formed in this way: they took the men who knew the
most about an act or a crime, the men who had been eye-witnesses;
they called them together and got what they
knew about it, and made up the decision. In our day they
take the men who know the least about it, and the biggest
fools in all the land; (I hope one thing will come, and that
is this—I do not suppose anybody here has been on a jury,
or I would not make this remark—I hope the day will come
when we will have such times as this, that you can get a
jury who will not let a scoundrel off and perjure themselves.
Let us reform the jury laws. The Chautauqua Circle might
accomplish much in that way).</p>

<p>One account of his death is this: When he was dying, in
901, he called to his side Edward, and said: Now, my dear
son, sit down beside me and I will deliver to you the true
counsel. I feel that my hour is near: my face is pale; my
days are nearly run; we soon must part; I shall go to
another world and thou shalt be left alone with all my
wealth. I pray thee, for thy heart, my dear child, strive to
be a father and a lord to thy people. Be the children’s
father, the widow’s friend, comfort the poor, shelter the
weak, and with all thy might do thou right whatever is
wrong. And, my son, govern thyself by law, and then the
Lord shall love thee, and God, above all things, shall be
thy reward.</p>

<p>And so departed the peaceable, the truth-teller, England’s
darling. His bones are dust, his good sword rust, his soul
is with the saints we trust.</p>

<p>And Edward followed him, a truly great ruler. He held
all the realm south of the Humber. He claimed the lordship
over Northumbria, Wales and Scotland. That lordship
came to be contested. For the first time all the isle of
Britain came to be united under one monarch. And he was
a West Saxon. Thus the unity of England was virtually
established.</p>

<p>There were fierce struggles by the succeeding king, but
one final result was that the Scots gained some ground,
some territory. Their southern line was brought down to
about here [pointing], that is from the Solway to Berwick,
where it remains, and where a new basis was laid for Scottish
civilization. In that portion of the country is the
border land so long renowned for many a story, for many a
fight, for many a poem. Walter Scott celebrates many of
the marches in many of his stories and songs.</p>

<p>Now a third thing: The incorporation of the Danes. If
England would retain her national character, she must have
power of absorption and a Christian spirit. What was to
be done with the Danes—with all the Danish element here
in the Danelagh. That same Danish element was here
when you have the map even in this form. There were
some other people mingled with them, but the Danes held
the controlling power, and those Norse settlers, in some
parts of it, may have been few, but still they had the power.
Now they gradually learned English, English manners, and
acquired the English spirit. They learned English Christianity,
and gradually conformed in everything. And here
is one remarkable fact: the Scandinavian people, the people
of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, have always been a people
disposed to conform to the people with whom they lived.
In France they became Frenchmen; in Russia they became
Russians; in Italy they became Italians; in Ireland they
became intensely Irish, and so now in this country, they
become Americans more readily and more gracefully than
the Germans.</p>

<p>About 911 a viking left Norway, left his two little isles,
and sailing about came down here [pointing]. Alfred
warded him off. He sailed about for some time and then
he entered the Seine (911), got possession of this valley, married
a French princess, put on white robes and for a few
days acted as a Christian gentleman. He invited all sea-rovers
into this valley, and they made a splendid country
of it. Still more and more of these settlers came, and thus
Normandy rose among the nations. It became a tremendous
power. Not so much at first with her sword as with
her civilization. It may seem rather strange that this
Norse colony should take the lead in western Europe, should
take the lead in civilization, in culture, learning, architecture,
scholarship; yet that is the fact. Norman will,
both of the noble and weak kind, had its way in enlarging
this realm during the sway of four successive dukes.</p>

<p>Then we come to Robert the Magnificent, who wedded
the sister of Canute. He attempted to invade England and
failed. He was father of William. He would not fail, and
the enterprise with which the father had been unsuccessful
remained as an inheritance for the son. His father died on
a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1035. He was left ruler over
some of the most lawless and turbulent barons in Europe.
He was scarcely eight years old, and his record of thirty
years while reorganizing Normandy and in bringing the
nobles to order is a proof of his real greatness. He fought
his way, he gained his dukedom, he broke up nests of
treason, he destroyed castles, he upset conspiracies, he
showed what one young man could do, when he had definite
aims, wise plans, fixed principles, and industry and
resolution, courage and firmness, and the ability to keep
what he had gained.</p>

<p>William was a hard man, austere, exacting, persevering.
His heavy hand made the English themselves comprehend
their own national unity through a unity of suffering. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
they had not perished for a moment, they would not have
survived for ages. My time is spent or we would leap from
the eleventh to the thirteenth century, and emphasize our
last points, <i>resistance to the Pope, and organization of the
House of Commons</i>. But these you can think of at your
leisure.</p>

<h2><a name="REASONS_FOR_THE_STUDY_OF" id="REASONS_FOR_THE_STUDY_OF">REASONS FOR THE STUDY OF
GREEK.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By <span class="smcap">Prof.</span> H. LUMMIS.</p>


<p>By those best qualified to judge, the thorough study of
Greek is conceded to be the very highest kind of mental
discipline and culture.</p>

<p>George P. Marsh, in his lectures on the English language,
thus speaks: “Let me repeat, that so far from dissuading
from the study of Greek, as a branch of general education,
I do but echo the universal opinion of all persons competent
to pronounce on the subject, in expressing my own conviction
that the language and literature of ancient Greece constitute
the most efficient instrument of mental training ever
enjoyed by man: and that a familiarity with that wonderful
speech, its poetry, its philosophy, its eloquence, and the history
it embalms, is incomparably <i>the most valuable of intellectual
possessions</i>.” Such testimony from so eminent a
scholar, and from so critical a mind is decisive in regard to
the value of the study of Greek as a discipline, as well as
in respect to the richness of the literature which it contains.</p>

<p>In the field of art we admit that he who would be great must
study the great models, and be directed by competent masters.
Even a Raphael owes something of his high renown
to the patient diligence with which he studied the best
pieces of his master Pietro Vanucci, the most noted artist
of his day. So he who aspires to become a master in the
expression of thought will wisely seek the masterpieces of
those who have embalmed great thought in the most finished
and excellent language. That the writers of Greece
are preëminently the writers who have done this as profound
and widely read a linguist as Max Müller testifies.
He says: “What the inhabitants of the small city of
Athens achieved in philosophy, in poetry, in art, in science,
in politics, is known to all of us; and our admiration for
them increases tenfold if, by a study of other literatures,
such as the literatures of India, Persia, and China, we are
enabled to compare their achievements with those of other
nations of antiquity. The rudiments of almost everything,
with the exception of religion, we, the people of Europe,
the heirs to a fortune accumulated during twenty or thirty
centuries of intellectual toil, owe to the Greeks; and strange
as it may sound, but few, I think would gainsay it, that to
the present day the achievements of these, our distant ancestors
and earliest masters, the songs of Homer, the dialogues
of Plato, the speeches of Demosthenes, and the
statues of Phidias, stand, if not unrivalled, at least unsurpassed
by anything that has been achieved by their descendants
and pupils. Like their own goddess, Athene, the
people of Athens seem to spring full armed into the arena
of history; and we look in vain to Egypt, Syria, or India
for more than a few of the seeds that burst into such marvellous
growth on the soil of Attica.”</p>

<p>He belittles human nature who thinks the practical value
of commercial arithmetic to be greater than such a mastery
of language as shall enable one to express himself correctly
in his own tongue. To study an instrument for the expression
of thought, so wonderfully flexible, so admirably exact,
so widely comprehensive, so astonishingly strong, is to
the student of his native tongue what training in a great international
exposition of machinery, like that exhibited in
Philadelphia in our centennial year, would be to a bright
young mechanic, a schooling of incalculable worth. What
an insight it gives into the subtle changes in the forms of
words; what a comprehension of the root meanings of words,
what an idea of the power of arrangement in words, what a
conception of the music and beauty in the sounds of words.</p>

<p>Coleridge has admirably characterized the excellence of
this queen of languages: “Greek—the shrine of the genius
of the old world, as universal as our race; as individual as
ourselves; of infinite flexibility; of indefatigable strength;
with the complication and distinctness of Nature herself;
with words like pictures; with words like the gossamer film
of summer, at once the variety and picturesqueness of Homer;
the gloom and intensity of Æschylus; not compressed
to the closest by Thucydides, nor fathomed to the bottom by
Plato; not sounding with all its thunders nor lit up with
all its ardors under the Promethean touch of Demosthenes.”
The thorough drill of a competent teacher in introducing the
student to the Greek tongue, is a most valuable discipline to
the memory; the acquisition of multitudes of roots and affixes
is of high importance to a full comprehension of the
meaning of words in our own language, the exercise of the
judgment in distinguishing words of like or of opposite
meanings, the fine force of the particles of the language, and
the delicate shades of thought given by variation in mode
or tense, has far higher value as a broad training of that faculty
than the most thorough mathematical discipline.</p>

<p>The improved methods of instruction have removed the
old objection that it takes a lifetime to acquire the language.
The objection applies as much to music, or even to a single
kind of music: it takes a lifetime to become perfect master
of the violin.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_UGLY_MAN" id="THE_UGLY_MAN">THE UGLY MAN.</a></h2>


<p>I was the youngest but one of a large family, of whom the
daughters were remarkable for their personal beauty, while
the sons, of whom I was the last, graduated in plainness
that was all but repulsive. This peculiarity, by which the
beauty was given to the girls and the plainness to the boys,
had been in the family for generations; and, both in uncles
and aunts and cousins of either sex, is still discernible at
the time I write.</p>

<p>But that which, in my own case, made this personal deformity
an additional misfortune, was the fact, that, along
with my ugliness, I had inherited a most sensitive disposition.
And as there are never wanting persons to speak of
a child’s deficiencies even in its very presence, I soon became
aware of my defects. Not being precocious, I was
looked upon as more stupid than I was in fact; while the
real ability I possessed was altogether unsuspected. Often
indeed the gibes and jeers of my beautiful sisters, and the
rough remarks of my less ugly brothers, cut my childish
soul to the quick. <i>My small, flat, squab nose was in everybody’s
mouth.</i> I was told of it twenty times a day. Whoever
wanted something to do, found instant employment in
twitting me on the subject of this unlucky feature. I was
never allowed to forget it; and often have I stood in the
midst of a circle roaring with laughter at my expense. The
natural result followed: from being naturally over-sensitive,
I became only too keenly alive to the supposed opinions of
others. In church I sat with my head rigidly fixed on my
shoulders, turning myself neither to the right hand nor to
the left, lest the persons behind me should catch a glimpse
of my unlovely profile. I looked straight before me like an
arrow; and on leaving my seat, as I went down the aisle
and had to face my enemies and critics, I would hold my
cap up to my eyes, and endeavor to pass demurely by, with
nose unobserved.</p>

<p>Nor was my poor little nose my only cause of annoyance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
for my face was large and splay, my complexion was muddy
and pale, and the color of my eyes was a washed-out green.
The space too between my nose and upper lip was long and
protuberant, and my lips themselves were in full bloom like
those of a negro. Indeed, the only thing in my favor, as
regards personal appearance, was my hair, which was of a
glossy auburn, and curled naturally in profusion. But this,
my only redeeming feature, I was unacquainted with at the
time. In my ignorance (for though often told of my faults,
I never, as a child, heard myself praised), I even looked
upon this propensity in my hair to curl as a positive misfortune,
inasmuch as my friends informed me that it always
appeared unkempt and wild, and therefore I naturally
thought it an addition to my defects. Oh, how I envied the
oiled and trim locks of my companions, which showed no
such erratic tendency as mine; and in the agony of my
mind I often had recourse to the hairdresser, who, at my
directions, cut off close each offending curl, and sent me
home shorn. But, alas! my triumph was but short. Sisters
and brothers crowded round me soon, and proclaimed that
my large inanimate face only looked larger and more inanimate
still; while aunts and mother dismissed me from their
presence with the observation that I was now a perfect
fright.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the one thought uppermost in my childish
mind. I had a strong faith in my own ugliness. Happy
days and hours I had, as all healthy children will have. I
frolicked and played; and being naughty as well as ugly, I
was often whipped; while my pretty little sister, the youngest
of us all, being pretty as well as naughty, was only
scolded and warned. However, no punishment I ever received
(and I had many) hurt me so much as the oft-recurring,
never-long-absent reflection, that Nature, when
she turned me out of her mint, had impressed me with her
strongest stamp of ugliness. Nay, when at times a child’s
party was given at our house, and little neighbors came to
see us for a few hours, I was quick at observing how that
none of them took to me. If a game were proposed, I was
always assigned the lowest place in it. If others were kings
and queens, I was only a servant and a slave; and when
others were captains and admirals, I was a common sailor;
and on one occasion, which I well remember, I was degraded
to the position of powder-monkey. It seemed indeed
by universal, tacit consent that I should be thus used;
and in my own secret little heart I attributed the cause to
my ugliness. Often while I joined in the game and
shouted my utmost, I was in reality sad and disheartened;
and have more than once climbed a tree and hid myself in
its topmost branches, while the sport proceeded in the garden
below, and my absence was unnoticed.</p>

<p>Thus it was that my childhood fled away, till, as time
progressed, the evil became more serious. Having been so
often rebuffed and humiliated, I lost all ambition to excel.
Insensibly I acquiesced in the idea that I was in all points
inferior to others, and that no efforts of my own could ever
raise me to their level. My friends now not only called me
ugly, but stupid. My plain elder brother was undeniably
clever. My plainer second brother was shrewd, but I was
both the ugliest and stupidest of all. At first I wept at this
double discovery. I then grew content at being at the bottom
of my class at school. My master held me up to ridicule
(the rascal has since been made a bishop), and that,
too, not only because I was backward and idle, for in these
respects I richly deserved his blame; but, alas! for poor human
nature so apt to be biased by mere externals, because I
was ugly. I felt at the time that, had I not been so very
plain, my being a dunce would have been more overlooked.
I saw good-looking dunces in the class with me, who were
easily pardoned; but I was an ugly dunce, and therefore
was ridiculed and punished. This treatment made me sullen.
At last I never cared to work at all. I copied my
exercises and blundered over my translations so much, that
the master grew tired of hearing me, and would often pass
me over entirely—a course that pleased me exceedingly,
and only confirmed me in my idleness. I was called stupid,
and I became stupid; and I discovered, till I half became a
little misanthrope, that the ugliness for which I was bantered
at home, caused me also to be treated with greater
harshness for my faults at school.</p>

<p>Nor was it my enforced stupidity alone that thus gave the
sting to my plainness, but my poverty. My father was very
badly off. I wore my elder brothers’ old clothes, which
were too large for me. I assumed, I recollect, on one occasion
one of their cast-off hats, and it overshadowed me
completely. My well-dressed school-fellows christened me
Guy Fawkes on account of my frumpish attire: and one of
them, kinder than the rest, came to me one day when I was
all alone, and told me he was sorry for me. This last incident
completed my humiliation. I did not weep but I kept
very silent for a day or two. I entered into no sports. I
walked apart and thought of my ugliness, my stupidity,
my poverty; nor was it till a week or more had passed
away that I regained my usual spirits.</p>

<p>Shortly after the above-mentioned events, when I was
about fourteen years of age, my poor father began to think
seriously of the future career of his ugly bantling. And
now a fresh sorrow awaited me. My acquirements were so
small, my manners and appearance so unprepossessing,
that there was great difficulty in deciding on my future
course. “Come here, Jack,” said my father one day to me.
“Can you read well?” “No,” he answered for me. “Can
you write well?” “No,” he said again. “Can you cast
accounts well?” “No,” he replied once more. “You can
do nothing well, but take birds’ nests. I don’t know at
all what is to become of you.”</p>

<p>On hearing these words, poor Jack left the room very
much crestfallen; and quite agreed with his father, that he
did not at all know what was to become of him, being both
the ugliest and stupidest of his family. “Send him to college,
father, and make a clergyman of him,” suggested an
amiable and compassionate sister, thinking more of her
brother’s feelings than the Church’s interests. This last
speech of hers I overheard, as I was disappearing through
the doorway, with the additional words: “Perhaps he may
just pass through, without being absolutely plucked.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">********</div>

<p>Since the above-mentioned scenes, years have passed
away and a great change has come over me. I have already
said more than once that I was a backward boy, and very
lazy over my books. About the age of sixteen years, however,
a visible alteration took place in this respect. At the
suggestion of a sister (a suggestion indeed half made in
fun), I was induced to try my hand at writing verses. At
first I refused, being quite aghast at such a daring proposal;
but on the request being repeated, I complied. Then
it was that I caught the first sound of praise my ugly ears
had ever heard yet. She and I were both alike surprised. I
could not believe that I had composed the poem out of my
own stupid head. I read it over and over again, and each
time with increasing wonder. I was actually startled at
myself, while the pleasing idea stole into my mind that I
was not so great a fool after all.</p>

<p>Nor did the matter end there. The verses were taken to
another sister, and were praised by her in turn. My second
brother also, who saw them next, declared boldly that they
were not mine; or if they were, must have been made up of
odds and ends by some unconscious trick of the memory.
The answer was easy: I knew no poetry, and therefore the
idea of plagiarism had no grounds to rest upon. And this
last consideration made my triumph complete. My intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
being awoke from its long slumber, and sprang at
once into conscious life. Poetry became a passion. I read
all I could lay my hands upon. I composed and filled volumes
with my own lucubrations; my spirit within me
yearned under the burden of a thousand new and contending
romantic emotions; and while I continued busily my
classical studies (for about this time it was settled that I
should go to college), I read and wrote much in addition,
and was never idle for a single moment.</p>

<p>Still, though the first step had thus been taken in the
right direction, much remained to be done. When alone
with my books, I felt and enjoyed the freedom I had acquired.
I no longer looked on myself as below my fellow-men,
but recognized my birthright of intellectual power,
and delighted in the exercise of it. The case, however, was
different when I was with strangers, or even with members
of my own family. Immediately the fancied giant slunk
back again into the stunted dwarf. The fault of my education
came over me like a cloud. The lesson that had been
drilled into me so early was not to be easily eradicated; and
the consequence was, that, while my indignant spirit secretly
rebelled at my own cowardice, I was obliged to submit
with a good grace, and cut but a poor figure in the eyes
of my companions and fellow-students.</p>

<p>Nor did this proud diffidence lose in intensity when I was
introduced into the little world of academical life. The
same fault haunted me still; and keeping aloof from others,
I not only forfeited many advantages, but likewise ran the
risk, incurred by all solitary men, of increasing selfishness
and egotism. Circumstances, however, in some degree
broke down this barrier to freedom of intercourse with
others, which unwise friends had unconsciously helped to
raise; and though I had a small but select circle of acquaintances,
my evil genius was still with me; and I finally left
the university, having missed much it was calculated to
teach.</p>

<p>My next experience dates from the time when I found
myself a curate in a large manufacturing town. All my old
troubles began over again. When I stood up in public, my
sensitiveness came back to me with tenfold force. The
thought of my extreme ugliness, the recollection of my
ridiculously little and flat nose, overwhelmed me with confusion.
I was keenly alive to the ludicrous: and hence the
picture I involuntarily drew of myself wounded my vanity
in the extreme. My first appearance in the desk was formidable.
I was miserable. My poor little nose, through
intense self-consciousness, actually ached on my face. If
I caught the full glance of an eye, I suspected at once that
it was fixed on that particular feature; and I had by an express
effort to call all my reasoning powers together to lay
this ghost of my own morbid fancy.</p>

<p>This extreme sensitiveness, however, soon began to wear
off. I made up my mind to be ugly; and the strong brotherhood
I felt with many others in this respect came to the aid
of my philosophy.</p>

<p>But there was a worse evil, which was not so soon overcome.
Having been for so many years of my life looked
upon as stupid, I was now seized again with that distrust
of self which I had once so nearly shaken off. It seriously
crippled my usefulness; and I had the mortification to see
others, with half my abilities and acquirements, but more
self-reliant, occupy positions with applause where I was
compelled to be silent. The struggle in my heart was very
bitter; and if at last I did break through the trammels in
some degree, it was not till many a wasted year had flown,
and many a golden opportunity had gone by forever.</p>

<p>Like all other young men too, I fell in love, and then the
thought of my ugliness came down on me like a thunderbolt.
Of course the young lady was perfection, and her
nose a thorough contrast to my own. The fact that ugly
men often obtained beautiful wives was very consoling, I
allow; and I often ran over in my own mind a list of all the
plain men I knew who were married to lovely women.
Still my own ugliness distressed me, and I began in consequence
an awkward and unwieldy flirtation. I tried to be
agreeable, but my shyness prevailed; and I generally ended by
making some blunder, such as plunged me in disgrace.
Then a period of silence and distance would ensue, at which
the fair object of my affections was visibly piqued and puzzled;
and, as was but natural, soon let me feel her anger and
annoyance. Then immediately, with the proverbial inconsistency
of a lover, I forgot my own conduct that had
caused the alteration in her manner, and attributed the
change to a rooted dislike of my person. And so at last we
separated; and a happier rival appeared, who carried her off
at once, and wears the flower to this day.</p>

<p>After this event I began to look upon myself as a confirmed
bachelor. No woman, I thought would ever take me,
who have no gold to gild my ugliness; and I grew almost
contented with my solitude. But Providence ordered it
otherwise. This is not a love story, but a true tale; and
when I learnt from the lips of her I love best, some months
after marriage, that the honesty and intelligence, written
on my face, threw a veil over its ugliness and almost glorified
my insignificant and troublesome nose, I felt, and I
still feel, that if all the world thinks me ugly, I am perfectly
content with the verdict; and if most men have better
noses than myself, there are many without my share of
intellect and sense; or else with all their various defects,
they have no warm-hearted wife like mine, to love and admire
them for the few good qualities they possess.</p>

<p>But before I close, I have one more confession to make
after all. I never see a very good nose to this day without
thinking of my own bad one, and envying for the moment
the more fortunate possessor. To this day also, I am somewhat
shy both in public and in private, and can not wholly
get over that nervous regard for the opinions of others,
which my unwise training has only served to increase.
This defect in my character has hindered my advancement
in life. My little nose has prevented me from being a big
man. God, however, has richly blessed me in many ways.
I have a nice parish, a pleasant vicarage, a good wife and a
large family. Many kind friends, too, have gathered around
me, and assure me of increasing usefulness. Yet my one
great fault of intense self-consciousness haunts me still,
mars my enjoyment, unnerves me often in the very moment
of action, and makes me feel every day the evil
brought upon a too sensitive disposition, when defects,
whether physical or mental, are made a theme for ridicule
and banter, without regard to the present pain and future
loss such a course is only too sure to entail.—<i>Temple Bar.</i></p>

<p>A missionary steamer, whose hull and machinery weigh
only six tons, is now moored in the Thames, in London.
The vessel is named “Peace,” and has been built for the
Baptist Missionary Society, who destine it for the service of
the mission in the upper reaches of the Congo River. The
boat can be taken to pieces readily for transport purposes,
and the total number of pieces, none of which would be too
heavy for a man to carry, would be 800. The greatest possible
use has been made of all available space, and the two
cabins are admirably fitted. A kitchen adapted for a stove
and other cooking appliances forms part of the equipment.
A substantial awning covers the deck, and between this and
the sides of the vessel a wire awning is fitted to stop arrows
and other missiles. It is intended to take the steamer to pieces
and pack the sections in boxes, which will be sent to the
mouth of the Congo. From thence they will be borne by
800 men a distance of 300 miles up to Stanley Pool, where
the steamer will be reconstructed by missionaries.</p>

<h3>1.—AIM.</h3>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>This new organization aims to promote habits of reading and study in nature, art,
science and in secular and sacred literature, in connection with the routine of daily
life (especially among those whose educational advantages have been limited), so as
to secure to them the college student’s general outlook upon the world and life, and
to develop the habit of close, connected, persistent thinking.</p>
</div>

<h3>2.—METHODS.</h3>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It proposes to encourage individual study in lines and by text-books which shall
be indicated; by local circles for mutual help and encouragement in such studies; by
summer courses of lectures and “students’ sessions” at Chautauqua, and by written
reports and examinations.</p>
</div>

<h3>3.—COURSE OF STUDY.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The course of study prescribed by the C. L. S. C. shall cover a period of four years.</p>

<h3>4.—ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Each year’s course of study will be considered the “first year” for new pupils,
whether it be the first, second, third or fourth of the four years’ course. For example,
“the class of 1886,” instead of beginning October, 1882, with the same studies which
were pursued in 1881-’82 by “the class of 1885,” will fall in with “the class of ’85,”
and take for their first year the second year’s course of the ’85 class. The first year for
“the class of 1885” will thus in due time become the fourth year for “the class of 1886.”</p>

<h3>7.—SPECIAL COURSES.</h3>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. may take, in addition to the regular course above prescribed,
one or more special courses, and pass an examination upon them. Pupils
will receive credit and testimonial seals to be appended to their regular diploma, according
to the merit of examination on these supplemental courses.</p></div>


<h3>8.—THE PREPARATORY COURSE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Persons who are too young, or not sufficiently advanced in their studies, to take
the regular C. L. S. C. course, may adopt certain preparatory lessons for one or more
years.</p>

<p>For circulars of the preparatory course, address Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield,
N. J.</p></div>


<h3>9.—INITIATION FEE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To defray the expenses of correspondence, memoranda, etc., an annual fee of fifty
cents is required. This amount should be forwarded to Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield,
N. J. (by New York or Philadelphia draft, or post-office order on Plainfield, N.
J.) Do not send postage stamps if you can possibly avoid it.</p>

<p>N. B.—In sending your fee, be sure to state to which class you belong, whether
1883, 1884, 1885, or 1886.</p></div>


<h3>10.—APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Persons desiring to unite with the C. L. S. C. should forward answers to the following
questions to Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield, N. J. The class graduating in
1886 should begin the study of the lessons required October, 1882. They <i>may</i> begin as
late as January 1, 1883.</p>

<p>1. Give your name in full. 2. Your postoffice address, with county and State.
3. Are you married or single? 4. What is your age? Are you between twenty
and thirty, or thirty and forty, or forty and fifty, or fifty and sixty, etc.? 5. If
married, how many children living under the age of sixteen years?<a name="FNanchor_H_9" id="FNanchor_H_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_9" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> 6. What is
your occupation? 7. With what religious denomination are you connected? 8.
Do you, after mature deliberation, resolve, if able, to prosecute the four years’ course
of study presented by the C. L. S. C.? 9. Do you promise to give an average of
four hours a week to the reading and study required by this course? 10. How much
more than the time specified do you hope to give to this course of study?</p>
</div>

<h3>11.—TIME REQUIRED.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An average of forty minutes reading each week day will enable the students in nine
months to complete the books required for the year. More time than this will probably
be spent by many persons, and for their accommodation a special course of reading
on the same subject has been indicated. The habit of thinking steadily upon
worthy themes during one’s secular toil will lighten labor, brighten life, and develop
power.</p></div>


<h3>12.—MEMORANDA.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The annual examinations will be held at the homes of the members, and in writing.
Memoranda will be forwarded to them, and by their written replies the committee can

<h3>C. L. S. C. Literature.</h3>

<p>Among the many notable features connected with Chautauqua
work, not the least is the influence of the C. L. S. C. on the educational
literature of the times. Book making of a peculiar sort, to
meet a special demand, has been one of its results. It is a maxim of
commerce that whenever there is a demand there will be a supply to
meet it. It is not strange that the supply did not exist at the beginning,
for the demand, the want of a school of the people, such as
the C. L. S. C. aims to be, is without precedent in our history.
Books for the public schools and academies lacked adaptability as
well as attractiveness in many instances. The greater part of them
were too elementary, being prepared for younger minds and those
more advanced and mature were generally too special in their character,
failing to give that “outlook” which figures so largely in the
Chautauqua Idea. It had to be recognized that the mind of one
grown to adult years, though perhaps no farther advanced in a particular
branch of study than the boy at school, yet because of other
development, experience and observation required that the subject
be presented in a different manner. College text books were not
suited to the needs of the student of this People’s College. They
were often too deep and not wide enough, too much of the students’
<i>sanctum</i> to be suited to the fireside of the home.</p>

<p>A glance at the list of the Chautauqua text books, as they are
found in the advertising pages of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, will suggest
somewhat the extent and character of this feature. It will be seen
that this literature is being published and sold by some of the best publishing
houses in the country, and that writers and authors of high
reputation have given their talent to meet this want. Let even the
disinterested reader examine this list. They are <i>sui generis</i>. Wide
in their range as the scope of the C. L. S. C. course, simple and attractive
in the manner of treating the various subjects, yet philosophical
and thorough in the best sense. They are the books that
thousands, scattered here and there, thirsting for knowledge, have
felt the need of without knowing they were attainable, and which
were unattainable till this demand became focalized by the organization
of the C. L. S. C. This new literature is therefore filling a
wider sphere than the organization which called it into existence.
Upon the table of many a professional man, and in many a home
where there is not a desire to pursue a full course of study, these
books find their way, by reason of the very peculiarities aimed at in
their preparation. We do not speak here of the effect that such
books is destined to exercise upon the writers of text-books for the
schools and academies and colleges, nor of the quickening effect
upon publishers to furnish a wide and varied range of books on all
these and other subjects to meet the increased demand arising from
mental appetites awakened by this course, nor do we venture to
prophesy the dimensions to which this literary influence will grow.
Mr. Bayard Taylor says that the literary bloom of the eighteenth
century in Germany was largely indebted to the popular guilds of
the “mastersingers” of preceding centuries. A great popular educational
movement like the C. L. S. C. cannot fail to have a large influence
on the popular literature of the future.</p>

<h3>The Prospect for a Revival of Spiritual Religion.</h3>

<p>There is evidently great need of a revival of spiritual religion in all
the churches of the land. The fact that most of the great Christian
bodies are increasing very slowly in membership, and that some of
them, according to their own statistics for the past year, have suffered
an actual loss, is evidence that the Church at large is not
blessed with the vitality and spiritual power she ought to have.
Another significant fact is, that the non-church-going element in
both city and country is rapidly on the increase, so that it is estimated
that from one-fourth to one-half of the population of the country,
seldom, if ever, attend religious services. Indeed we are personally
acquainted in communities, and that outside of cities, too, in
which the steady church-going element does not comprise more than
one-eighth of the population. In view of these things we are led to
inquire what are the prospects for the much-needed revival of spiritual
religion.</p>

<p>All revivals are necessarily of divine origin, but are dependent on
human agency to make them operative among men. The Church is
the agency through which divine influences have always been manifested
to the world. A revival has never been known to begin outside
the Church. The reformation began with Luther, a member of
the Romanish Church. The great modern revival movement called
Methodism began with Wesley, a member of the Episcopal Church.
Concerning the Holy Spirit, there can be no doubt but he is always
ready to do his work. The question then is this: Is the Church in
condition to secure the spirit in awakening and converting power.
This question must be answered in many instances in the negative
and for the following reasons:</p>

<p>We must admit that a spirit of worldliness pervades the Church to
an alarming degree. In the mad chase after material things that
characterizes our age, Christians are seemingly as eager in pursuit of
temporal things for temporal ends as are those who make no pretensions
to a religious life. The love of money, which is the “root
of all evil,” is productive of covetousness, which, like a deadly dry-rot,
is destructive of spirituality, eliminates spiritual longings from
the soul, and renders the man gross and groveling. In part as a result
of this world-spirit developed in the Church, there has been engendered
a lamentable indifference to vital piety. The religious
forms remain, but the warmth, the glow, the fervor and the power
of religion are often sadly wanting. In fact, modern culture too often
frowns on fervency either in the pew or pulpit; and too often the
sermon, instead of being a powerful appeal to the hearts and consciences
of men, and awakening dead souls from the sleep of sin, is
only a moral or æsthetic essay or oration, of the conventional half-hour
pattern, and deals mainly in glittering generalities. The discussion
in the pulpit, in the right spirit, of the justice of God, the
exceeding sinfulness of sin, eternal punishment, human redemption
by Jesus Christ, and kindred themes, will arouse men to duty, but
these themes are by some thought to be unpopular. Consequently
the thunders of Sinai are hushed and men are soothed by a sort of
emasculated gospel into carnal security, both concerning themselves
and their fellow-men, and make but little effort to raise themselves
or others to a higher spiritual life.</p>

<p>The increasing secularization of the Sabbath is another great hindrance
to a revival of spiritual religion. The sanctity of this day is
essential to the spirituality of the Church, and whatever interferes
with the proper religious observance of the day tends to destroy
vital religion among the people.</p>

<p>In spite of these unfavorable symptoms which are manifest at
present in the body of believers, we do not despair of the ultimate
success of the Church in accomplishing her mission. There are
many sincere, efficient and godly workers in the ranks of all denominations
who are earnestly longing and laboring for the salvation of
the world, but we fear for the present, at least, that their efforts are
being neutralized by the worldliness, indifference, lukewarmness
and formalism which characterize a large portion of the Church, so
that the near future will not witness a grand revival of spiritual religion.
We would be most heartily glad, however, if our forebodings
should prove ill-founded, and if there should come upon the Universal
Church a divine baptism which would consume all the dross of
sin and make her more successful in winning souls.</p>

<h3>Success of the Natural Method in Language at Chautauqua.</h3>

<p>The natural method has been for several years past on trial, and
has achieved a marked success. It has been practically demonstrated
that in a very short time persons can be taught to speak
French or German, or indeed any language for which there is a competent
living teacher. The modern languages have been most successful
because it is not easy to find those sufficiently familiar with
the ancient ones to give to their pupils the necessary practice in
them. Yet, even Greek and Latin have been taught to be spoken in
this way. In the modern languages, however, but a few weeks have
been needed to enable persons to speak them fluently and understand
them well when spoken. From the beginning the scholar is
taught to speak in the simple way in which the mother-tongue is
taught in childhood. With the very first lesson single words at the
beginning and then some simple phrases are mastered. These are
increased with each succeeding lesson, and soon the pupil finds that
he has quite a store of the words and phrases most commonly in
use. By frequent practice these are retained, and others being daily
added, at the end of six weeks, or thereabouts, of constant study,
any ordinary conversation can be carried on with a facility which astonishes
those accustomed only to the slow and tedious processes
of the older methods.</p>

<p>It has been fortunate for the Chautauqua Assembly that teachers
have taught here from the beginning who have been thoroughly devoted
to this method of instruction. Hence the success of the
schools, which have already attained to very large numbers, and
have secured enthusiastic interest in all those who have attended
them. Though the number of last year exceeded that of any that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
preceded it, it was but an earnest of what is yet to come. Any prediction
of the future outcome of these schools, which would be recognized
as at all moderate by others, would fall far short of what is
confidently expected of them by those familiar with this natural
method of instruction, and with the success with which it has met in
the Chautauqua schools.</p>

<h3>William Penn and His Policy.</h3>

<p>The recent celebration of the bi-centennial of the landing of William
Penn on this continent has once more attracted public attention
to the founder of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Penn
was a prominent personage during his lifetime and figured largely
both in England and this country. His character was an odd mixture
of fanaticism and moderation, and in his public career he managed
to so blend Quaker simplicity and worldly wisdom that he was
a great light in his sect and at the same time was possessed of great
influence in court circles, especially during the reign of James II.</p>

<p>He received his patent for the territory now forming the State
which bears his name from the crown, in payment of a debt of
£16,000 due to his father, who had been an admiral in the English
navy during the reign of Charles II. When he came to this country
in 1682 to take possession of his grant, he did not endeavor to drive
out by force the Indian tribes which occupied it, but formed a treaty
of peace and friendship with them on such terms that the land made
over to him by the crown was ceded to him and his colonies by the
consent of the aboriginal inhabitants. In all his relations with the
Indians he treated them with such justice and benevolence that his
colonies were never molested by them, but enjoyed uninterrupted
peace and prosperity. Of this treaty made by Penn with the Indians
Voltaire said that it was “the only treaty never sworn to and
never broken.”</p>

<p>Penn’s treatment of the Indians was as anomalous as it was wise
and statesmanlike. Had a similar policy characterized the leaders
and members of other colonies this country would have been spared
many scenes of horror and years of bloodshed, and the story of the
red men’s wrongs would never have disgraced its records. Penn’s
course in this matter was all the more remarkable in that it was
utterly foreign to the spirit of the age in which he lived. War was
the trade of kings and their representatives. Its rude alarms were
preferred to the “piping sounds of peace,” and the sword was
deemed a more honorable emblem than the olive branch. Penn
showed his greatness by rising completely above the spirit and temper
of his times in the policy he pursued in relation to the Indians.</p>

<p>The world has grown wiser with the flight of time, and now, after
the lapse of two centuries, the peace policy which Penn adopted in
his treatment of the Indians is becoming more and more the policy
of the nations toward one another. War has been found to be the
most costly and cruel method of settling national difficulties. Besides
causing the slaughter of millions of men, it has been the means
of loading the states of Europe, as well as our own country, with
burdensome debts which the coming generations of peace-loving
men must pay. As the world becomes more thoroughly civilized
and Christianized war will be looked upon as a relic of barbarism,
and will be shunned as a horrid crime. National differences will be
settled by arbitration and mutual concessions instead of by an appeal
to arms, and the prophetic declaration that men “shall beat
their swords into plough-shares and their spears into pruning
hooks” will be fulfilled in spirit if not in letter.</p>

<p>C. L. S. C. students will find the following item of special interest
in connection with this year’s course of study: Of all Scandinavian
men of letters, none, perhaps, commands a wider, deeper influence
than Dr. Gorg Brandes, whose name has become familiar in many
lands by his personal association with leading thinkers and writers in
England, France, and Germany, his manful contests with ecclesiastical
prejudices, and his persistent efforts to introduce modern ideas
into the hide-bound universities of the North. Ten years ago, after
a determined struggle, he obtained the nomination to the chair of
Literature in the University of Copenhagen, but was rejected at last
through the influence of the metropolitan bishop. Since then he
has been living in Berlin, and the university chair has remained unoccupied.
At last, however, a committee of private citizens has
been formed, and has raised enough money to assure Dr. Brandes a
comfortable salary for ten years, if he will return to Copenhagen as
resident lecturer on literature at the University. Although the
salary thus offered him is not nearly as large as the one he now receives
at Berlin, he has accepted the proposition, and will begin his
first course of lectures in Copenhagen about Christmas next. There
is room for hope that the influence of his thought and scholarship
will so aid the progress of toleration and liberal ideas that when the
ten years expire the Church will offer no opposition to his occupying
the chair that has so long been awaiting him.</p>

<p><i>Zion’s Herald</i>, of Boston, Mass., puts individual responsibility in a
nutshell in this item: “Who can tell the importance of one vote?
It is said that when the war of 1812 was declared, the measure was
carried in the United States Senate by one majority. One of those
senators was elected, in the Rhode Island Legislature, by one majority,
and one member of that legislature was detained at home unexpectedly,
who, if he had been present, would have voted against
that senator. He was about getting on the stage to go to the legislature
in the morning of the day of the vote, when, casually looking
around, he saw that his pigs had got out of the pen and were in
mischief. He stopped at home to take care of them and could not
reach the legislature that day. One vote changes many currents.
Massachusetts once had a governor elected by one plurality. Every
good man should be counted on the right side.”</p>

this nation ever produced. The women have divided their
work into several departments: temperance literature, the evangelistic
work, prison and police station work, the Southern work, the German
work, work among colored people, the young women’s work,
hygiene, legislative department, etc., etc. The convention was entertained
handsomely by the good people of Louisville. Its session was
harmonious, and its proceedings will create a stronger temperance
sentiment wherever they are read. Miss Frances E. Willard was
re-elected president, receiving every vote of every delegate in the convention,
and there were more than thirty States represented. Elsewhere
in this number of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> our readers will find an
article that was read before the convention, which traces the history
of the W. C. T. U. back to Chautauqua as the place of its origin. The
W. C. T. U., with its fifty thousand workers, can say of Chautauqua,
“I was born there.”</p>

<p>The <i>Advance</i> puts our “winter work” in these words: “It presses
now—what is it? First and chiefly, at least for ministers, to edify
believers in holy character; for the perfecting of the saints, the edifying
of the body of Christ. For it is Christian character which
converts sinners to Christ, which burns with a holy evangelistic
zeal, and is likely to secure conversions even without directly aiming
at them. It is consecrated character which has power with God
and with men.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bezkrovoff, a Russian engineer, is in this country. He said to
a reporter recently: “Our government ordered me to study your
ways and means of transportation. We have a costly system of
canals uniting our seas, the Baltic, the White, the Caspian, and the
Black; we have many great navigable rivers, and, besides, we have
built tens of thousands of versts of railroads, and yet transportation
in our country is in its infancy. Thousands of tons of grain rot annually
at our railroad stations, for there are no stores. In the
southern part of Russia there is abundance of fish, meat, vegetables,
and other provisions, and yet in the northern part of the country the
people can not afford to buy those provisions, for the cost of transportation
puts it beyond their means. We have plenty of coal and
kerosene, but at St. Petersburg, and even at Moscow, the English
coal and the American kerosene are cheaper than the Russian. Our
canals and railroads don’t pay to the government the cost of keeping.”</p>

<p>There are very few who have not been puzzled how to pronounce
some out-of-the-way word which has suddenly sprung into common
use. A bewildered reader writes to a Boston paper saying that the
pronunciation of Whittier’s “Maud Muller” has long been such a
puzzle to him. “When I was a little fellow,” he says, “I pronounced
it phonetically, of course, Mul-ler. Well, shortly after I heard a
literary gentleman—a judge, too—read the poem at an evening gathering,
and I noticed particularly he pronounced it Mü-ler. I made a
note of it and carried that pronunciation with confidence for a long
time, until one day in High School the teacher informed us that the
proper pronunciation of that name was ‘Mwë-ler.’ So I changed
my colors again and sailed under Mwëler for quite a while, until one
day I got into conversation with a young physician, a good German
student. ‘Oh, yes,’ said he, ‘I can tell you how to pronounce that
name! Whenever you see a German word with two dots over the
letter u, it is always pronounced as if immediately followed by an
r, thus: ‘Murl-er, Maud Murler.’ By this time I had lost all confidence
in everyone and decided to let the young lady severely
alone, but the other day I happened to run across a German fresh
from the old country, and I said: ‘Do you have any people over in
your land called Muller? M-u-l-l-e-r!’ ‘Oh, yes, plenty.’ ‘Well,
what do you call them—how do you pronounce it?’ ‘Miller,’ said
he. ‘It’s a very common name—Miller.’ I thanked him and left,
and now if there is another way in which that word can be pronounced
I should like to hear it. I am honestly seeking for information.”</p>

<p>A provoking error occurs in the first line on page 156 of this number.
It should read “The history of the origin of,” etc. The words

<p>At a recent meeting of the “Parker” C. L. S. C., in Washington, D.
C., Dr. H. A. Dobson illustrated how ice will move downward by
pressure of its own weight, applicable to the glacial chapter of
Packard’s Geology. In the top of a wooden bucket or tub, drive two
tacks or small nails on opposite sides, and about two inches apart.
Stretch across two fine iron wires—such as is used for wax flowers
will do—winding the wires around the tacks so as to be kept in position.
Upon the wires place a piece of clear ice, about six inches
long, four inches wide and two inches thick, placing the thin edge in
contact with the wires. Almost instantly the wires will be imbedded
in the ice, and in the course of an evening the downward movement
of the ice will be so great as to cause the wires to pass entirely
through the block of ice, which, strange as it may seem, unites again
below the wires, and though it is actually severed by the wires in
three parts by its course downward, it falls into the vessel a solid
piece, leaving no trace of the path the wires made. An interesting
question for C. L. S. C. readers to solve, after repeating the experiment,
is, Why does the ice re-unite?</p>

<p>[We solicit questions of interest to the readers of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
to be answered in this department. Our space does not always
allow us to answer as rapidly as questions reach us. Any relevant
question will receive an answer in its turn.]</p>

<hr class='shorter' />

<p>Q. Where is the Panthéon located in which Mirabeau’s body was
placed?</p>

<p>A. The Panthéon is in Paris. The foundation stone of the present
edifice was laid by Louis XV in 1764, and the church was dedicated
to St. Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris. In 1791 the convention
resolved to convert it into a kind of memorial temple, which they
named the Panthéon and inscribed on it the words, “<i>Aux grands
hommes la patrie reconnaissante</i>.” The old inscription still remains
and the familiar name is still popularly applied to the church. Mirabeau
was the first person whose remains were deposited in the
vaults.</p>

<p>Q. Which branch of mathematics should be taken up after arithmetic,
algebra, or geometry?</p>

<p>A. Algebra, which is the key to all the higher mathematics.</p>

<p>Q. What is the name of the River Jordan now?</p>

<p>A. Arab geographers call the river either El-Urdon, which is equivalent
to the Hebrew name, or Esh-sheriah, which signifies “the
watering place.” The latter is the name generally used by the
modern Syrians.</p>

<p>Q. In the course of study for this year is it obligatory to buy
Rolfe’s edition of Hamlet and Julius Cæsar, if one has some other
edition?</p>

<p>A. It is not obligatory. Any edition will be acceptable.</p>

<p>Q. What is the origin of the term Huguenots?</p>

<p>A. It is a name of uncertain origin, first applied by the Roman
Catholics of France to all partisans of the Reformation, but afterwards
restricted to the Calvinists. Some derive it from one of the
gates of the city of Tours, called <i>Hugons</i>, at which these Protestants
held some of their assemblies; others from the words <i>Huc nos</i>, with
which their protest commenced; others from <i>aignos</i>, a confederate.
Prof. Mahn, in his <i>Etymologische Untersuchungen</i>, quotes no fewer
than fifteen different derivations.</p>

<p>Q. What is Salmagundi, and from what is the name derived?</p>

<p>A. A mixture of minced veal, chicken, pickled herrings and onions
all chopped together and served with lemon juice and oil: so called,
it is said by some, from Salmagondi, one of the ladies attached to
the suite of Mary de Medicis, wife of Henry IV of France, who is
reputed to have invented the dish. The word is more probably a
corruption of the Latin <i>salgamum</i> (meat and salad chopped together).</p>

<p>Q. Which is the largest library in the world?</p>

<p>A. The National Library, in Paris, containing 2,000,000 volumes,
is the largest.</p>

<p>Q. I saw recently an allusion to the “Vinegar Bible,” but have no
idea what was meant. Can <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> tell me?</p>

<p>A. A Bible printed by the Clarendon press in 1717, by mistake gave
the heading to Luke xx as “The Parable of the Vinegar,” instead of
Vineyard.</p>

<p>Q. In what historic period was the Persian Avesta written?</p>

<p>A. The Avesta is one of the most ancient documents remaining to
us for the early history and religion of the Indo-European family.
It is made up of several distinct parts, and many circumstances favor
the theory of its collection into its present form during the early
part of the Sassanian period, about 226 A. D.</p>

<p>Q. I have access to “Hudson’s Shakspere;” will it be accepted in
place of Rolfe’s edition of “Hamlet” and “Julius Cæsar” in the required
reading for the White Seal Course for this year, 1882-83?</p>

<p>A. Yes, any edition.</p>

<p>Q. What is the meaning of Peter-pence?</p>

<p>A. An annual tribute of one penny paid at the feast of Saint Peter
to the see of Rome. It was collected in England from 740 till it was
abolished by Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Q. Please give a list of some of the best small works on Geology,
Mineralogy, and Paleontology.</p>

<p>A. “Text-book of Geology,” by Dana; “Geology for General Readers,”
by Page; “Elementary Geology,” by Gray; “Paleontology,”
by Owen; “Manual of Mineralogy,” by Dana; “Rudiments of Mineralogy,”
by Ramsay.</p>

<p>Q. What war is meant by the “Seven Years’ War?”</p>

<p>A. That of Frederick II of Prussia, against Austria, Russia, and
France (1756-1763).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a><br /><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. What is the origin of the word Tory?</p>

<p>A. The word is probably from the Irish <i>toruigh</i>, used in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth to signify a band of Irish robbers. Macaulay
says, “The name was first given to those who refused to concur in
excluding James from the throne.” He further says, “The bogs of
Ireland afforded a refuge to popish outlaws called <i>tories</i>.”</p>

<p>Q. What is the origin of the phrase, “to take a snack?”</p>

<p>A. It means to take a morsel, from Saxon <i>snœd</i>, a morsel, a share
or portion.</p>

<p>Q. Who was the author of the Dies Iræ?</p>

<p>A. It is probably the composition of Thomas a Celano, a native of
Abruzzi, who died in 1255, though its authorship is not certainly
fixed.</p>

<p>Q. Is it true that Mr. Gladstone is a Roman Catholic? I saw it so
stated recently.</p>

<p>A. No, he is a High Churchman.</p>

<p>Q. Is the “Life of Napoleon,” by the late J. S. C. Abbot, a reliable
book?</p>

<p>A. The author has been accused of partiality for his hero, but it
is up to the average of reliability of such books.</p>

<p>Q. How far back does the oldest record of the Chinese extend?</p>

<p>A. The history of China dates back nearly 5000 years, but up to
the year 2207 it is of a mythical character.</p>

<p>Q. Will you please inform me to what zoölogical class the starfish
belongs, and give some of its habits.</p>

<p>A. The starfish belongs to the class of echinoderms, and the order
asterioids. The zoölogical name is <i>asterias rubens</i>. A famous English
anatomist says starfishes may be considered as mere walking
stomachs, their office in the economy of nature being to devour all
kinds of garbage which would otherwise accumulate on the shores;
they eat also live crustaceans, mollusks, and even small fish, and are
believed to be very destructive to oysters.</p>

<p>Q. Is it true that the Methodist Episcopal Church forbids its ministers
the use of tobacco?</p>

<p>A. See discipline questions asked candidates for admission. They
are required to answer the question, but the conference may admit
them even though the question be answered negatively.</p>

<p>“This most splendid and complete book for
boys is offered to meet a longing felt by many
for a real, practical <i>American</i> boy’s book of
out-door sports and amusements. Those contained
within are intended for all ages past
babyhood, and will not be found too trivial to
engage the attention of grown-up people who
are fond of such sports. The aim has been to
give information about things that are practicable
for those who have not a great deal of
money at command.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Each particular
department is minutely illustrated, and
the whole is a complete treasury, invaluable
not only to the boys themselves, but to parents
and guardians who have at heart their
happiness, and healthful development of
mind and muscle.”—<i>Pittsburgh Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Lanier’s books, which made him the

country, and showed his remarkable talent
for guiding them into the best parts of this
ideal world, fitly close by giving the best of
the ballads in their purest and strongest form,
from Bishop Percy’s choicest collection. With
the <i>Boy’s Froissart</i>, the <i>Boy’s King Arthur</i>, the
<i>Mabinogion</i>, and the <i>Boy’s Percy</i>, Mr. Lanier’s
readers have the full circle of heroes.</p>

<p>“To wise parents, who strive, as all parents
should do, to regulate and supervise their
children’s reading, this book is most earnestly
commended. Would there were more of its
type and excellence. It has our most hearty
approval and recommendation in every way,
not only for beauty of illustration, which is of
the highest order, but for the fascinating manner
in which the old Norse legend is told.”—<i>The
Churchman.</i></p>

<p>“It gives in a popular form, in a charmingly
simple and picturesque style, the fascinating
romances of the old German epics. No more
delightful reading for the young can be imagined
than that provided in this interesting
book, and the manner of recital is so graceful
that older readers will derive from it scarcely
less pleasure.”—<i>Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

<div class="hang1">By <span class="smcap">Frank R. Stockton</span>. Illustrated by E. B.

<p>They are tales of, literally, enchanting sorcery
and fairy-prank, fantastic, grim, preposterous,
fanciful, astonishing, quaint, by turns,
and always brimful of humor,—a peculiarly
sly and irresistible humor of which Mr. Stockton
alone has the secret. All English-speaking
children will thank Mr. Stockton for the
delightful entertainment he has provided for
them. There is certainly no other living
writer who so deftly blends the purely imaginative
and the subtly humorous.</p>

following explanation would seem forced upon us. If the particles
forming the envelopes are minute flat bodies, and if anything in the
circumstances under which these particles are driven off into the
tail causes them to always so arrange themselves that the planes in
which they severally lie pass through the axis of the tail (which, if
the tail is an electrical phenomenon might very well happen) then
we should find the region behind the nucleus very dark, or almost
black, for the particles in the direction of the line of sight then would
be turned edgewise toward us, whereas those on either side or in the
prolongation of the envelopes would turn their faces toward the observer.</p></div>
